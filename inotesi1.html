<h3>Notes to Chapter 1. The Swastika Blessing in its Historical Context</h3>

<h4>What Is Unique About This Photograph</h4>

<a name="i101"></a><p><u>article</u>:  The article, in English translation, shows how a Nazi newspaper was able to take maximum advantage of the swastika blessing photo for emotional leverage to propagandize Catholics:
<blockquote>“Hatred Extending Beyond the Grave”
   <p>Many have already forgotten it:  when <em>Gauleiter</em> [regional Nazi Party boss] Peter Gemeinder died, the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church refused to give a Christian burial for the Catholic Peter Gemeinder.  They refused to do this because the deceased was a National Socialist.  
   <p>Because he was a man who hated the crime committed by the Jews and Jews' lackeys following the War, and who fought to make things better.  Because he was a man who honored priests and hated <em>Pfaffen</em> [see below].  Thus the National Socialist Peter Gemeinder was denied a Church funeral."
   <p>Hatred extending beyond the grave. –
   <p>In the Free City of Danzig, a Hitler Youth leader died.  Because he was Catholic, his mother wanted to have him buried according to Catholic custom.  The pastor refused to give the deceased Hitler Youth a church funeral if his comrades were present.  No Hitler Youth, whether Catholic or Protestant, may set foot in the cemetery or the church.  No Hitler Youth flag may bedeck the casket of the dead comrade.  If these requirements were not fulfilled, then the burial could not take place; so wrote the pastor to the grieving mother one day after the death of her son.

   <blockquote>Priests are men who feel inwardly compelled to stand by heavily burdened people in their sufferings and sorrows ... they even love their enemies ... Priests never point a finger at their fellow creatures, because they know that they themselves are only – human.  Priests do not make common cause with Jews… 
   <p>Pfaffen are men who want to appear better than they really are.  <em>Pfaffen</em> are hypocrites… <em>Pfaffen</em> are men for whom the consecrated garb of the priesthood serves only to gratify their egotism...  <em>Pfaffen</em> are men who have no qualms about exalting the Jewish people as the people of God...</blockquote>

<a name="i103"></a><p><u>historical work</u>:  The following photographs have received considerable publicity.
<p>1. Archbishop Vassallo di Torregrossa, the Vatican Nuncio to Bavaria, shaking hands with Hitler in Munich in 1933, under swastika flags.  This photograph is on the cover of Karlheinz Deschner’s <em>Mit Gott und dem Führer</em> [With God and the Führer] (1988).
<p>2. Two bishops giving Heil Hitler salutes alongside Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister), Frick (Nazi Interior Minister), and Bürkel (Nazi Regional Leader for the Saar District).  This photograph is on the cover of Gerhard Besier’s <em>Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich: Spaltungen und Abwehrkämpfe, 1934-1937</em>  [The Churches and the Third Reich: Divisions and Defensive Struggles] (2001).
<p>3.  Swastika flag displayed over the entrance to the Cologne Cathedral.  This photograph is on the cover of Alexander Gross’s <em>Gehorsame Kirche, Ungehorsame Christen im Nationalsozialismus</em> [Obedient Church, Disobedient Christians in the Nazi Era] (2000).
<p>4. Roadside crucifix beside sign saying “Jews are not wanted here.”  This photograph is on the cover of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen’s <em>A Moral Reckoning</em> (2002).
<p>5. Eugenio Pacelli being saluted by a German soldier at “present arms.”  This photograph is on the cover of John Cornwell’s <em>Hitler’s Pope</em> (1999) and Peter Godman’s <em>Der Vatikan und Hitler: Die Geheime Archive</em> [The Vatican and Hitler: The Secret Archives] (2004).
<p>6. Abbot Albanus Schachleiter rendering an ambiguous arm gesture, perhaps a blessing or perhaps a Heil Hitler salute, while reviewing Nazi stormtroops.  This photograph is on the cover of Kevin Spicer’s <em>Hitler’s Priests</em> (2008).
   <p>Of these photographs, only the 6th denotes conscious, deliberate favor upon the Nazi ideology or movement.  Photo number 1 was taken in a receiving line for the dedication of the new <em>Haus der Kunst</em> [House of Art], a museum which still exists today in Munich.  The swastikas in the photo were a function of the camera angle, not of an archbishop’s decision to confer favor on swastikas or Nazism.  The archbishop protested the Nazis’ exploitation of this photograph for propaganda purposes during a November 1933 nationwide referendum campaign.  Heinz Hürten, <em>Deutsche Katholiken, 1918-1945</em> [German Catholics] (1992).
   <p>The 2nd photo appears to be taken from a ceremony on March 1, 1935 welcoming the Saar District back into Germany.  All public officials in Nazi Germany, and Germans in general, were required to render Heil Hitler salutes.  Catholic Bishops were treated equivalent to public officials under the terms of the Vatican-Germany Concordat of 1933.  The flag on the Cologne Cathedral, photo number 3, reflects the pressure the Nazi regime brought to bear upon Bishops to display swastika flags on their churches on special nationwide memorial days.
   <p>The roadside crucifix in photo 4 is typical of rural scenes in historically Catholic areas of Germany and Europe.  The adjacent sign against Jews carries no indication of Church authority and could have been placed by local Nazis or by anyone.  Photo 5 dates from before the Nazi era.  It is a picture of Nuncio Pacelli leaving the New Year’s reception at the Presidential Palace of Paul von Hindenburg on January 1, 1928, and constitutes no evidence of any view on the part of Eugenio Pacelli toward Hitler or Nazism.
   <p>The swastika blessing photograph from <em>Der Stürmer</em> stands out from the others in this category for its apparent signification of deliberate, high level, authoritative Church approval for the swastika, in a context where no pressure of German law or Nazi intimidation could explain the event.  Photo 6 with Schachleiter is similar to it in its appearance of voluntary conferral of favor on the Nazi movement, but Schachleiter was known as a renegade pro-Nazi cleric who was repeatedly in conflict with Church authorities such as Cardinal Faulhaber, the Archbishop of Munich.  
   <p>An article about this set of pictures can be found in German, by Karl-Joseph Hummel, “Kirche im Bild: Historische Photos als Mittel der Irreführung” [Church in Pictures: Historical Photos as a Means of Deception], in Karl-Joseph Hummel and Michael Kissener, eds., <em>Die Katholiken und das Dritte Reich</em> [Catholics and the Third Reich] (2009), pp. 239-256.  Hummel does not mention the swastika blessing photograph from the <em>Stürmer</em>.</p><br>

<a name="i104"></a><p><u>displays</u>:  This is a photograph of a typical <em>Stürmer</em> display case.  
 

<p>The large sign above the display case says, “With the <em>Stürmer</em> against Jewry.”
<p>The slogan along the top of the display case says, “The Jews are our Misfortune,” a phrase popularized in the late 19th century by Heinrich von Treitschke, a prominent antisemitic, pro-Germanic racist in the German <em>Reichstag</em> [Imperial Parliament]. 
<p>The attraction of German youth to <em>Stürmer</em> display cases is described in this account by a sister of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the prominent German Christian who was killed by Hitler’s order in a concentration camp shortly before the Allies liberated it:
<blockquote>One day a notice-board was fixed to one of the trees in front of the school on which was written “The Father of the Jew is the Devil.”  Every day our two children passed under this piece of rabble-rousing on their way to school.  Then a box with the Nazi newspaper <em>Der Stürmer</em> with its abominations was set up opposite the school.  It contained anti-Semitic matter, fantastic accounts of sexual crimes and sadistic ritual acts allegedly practiced by the Jews and fabricated stories of the most obscene kind.  <em>The elder school children thronged in front of this.</em>”</blockquote>
<p>Eric Metaxas, <em>Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy</em> (2010), p.244, quoting from Sabine Leibholz-Bonhoeffer, <em>The Bonhoeffers: Portrait of a Family</em> (1971) (emphasis added).</p><br>

<a name="i105"></a><p><u>executed</u>:  In a country with time-honored constitutional protections for freedom of the press, it may be hard to imagine a person being executed, at the instance of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, for publishing a newspaper – until one encounters the <em>Stürmer</em>.  Its weekly demonization of the Jewish people succeeded in inciting a generation of readers to participate in mass murder of Jews, by convincing them that Jews in general were responsible for worldwide Communism and for ritual, sadistic and exploitive crimes that threatened the German people and all of Western civilization.  Justice Robert Jackson was the Allies’ chief prosecutor against Streicher at Nuremberg after World War II, where Streicher was convicted of crimes against humanity, consisting of direct incitement to murder, and executed in 1946.
   <p>“<em>Der Stürmer</em> is the most infamous newspaper in history.”  This is the opening sentence of an enlightening chapter on “<em>Der Stürmer</em>: ‘A Fierce and Filthy Rag,’” in Randall Bytwerk’s biography <em>Julius Streicher</em> (1983).

<h4>The Meaning of Blessing</h4>

<a name="i106"></a><p><u>manual</u>:  The quotation is from page 24 of <em>Roman Ritual: Book of Blessings</em> (New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., 1989).</p><br>

<a name="i106a"></a><p><u>diary</u>:  Alfred Baudrillart, <em>Les Carnets du Cardinal Baudrillart, 1930-1932</em> [The Notebooks of Cardinal Baudrillart] (1994-2003), pp. 818-819.  The quotation is translated from the original French.
   <p>Cardinal Sincero was Luigi Sincero, a Vatican official who was elevated to Cardinal in 1923, after serving for six years as head of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law.
 
<h4>The Meaning of the Swastika</h4>

<a name="i107"></a><p><u>My Battle</u>:  The frequently-cited Manheim translation of <em>Mein Kampf</em> (1943, 1992) asserts that translating from German to English is a straightforward matter.  (Introduction)  The limitations of this proposition deserve some attention, beginning with the title of <em>Mein Kampf</em>.  The German word <em>Kampf</em> can mean, depending on the context, struggle or battle or combat or fight.  For example, the German word for tank, <em>Panzer<strong>kampf</strong>wagen</em>, is properly translated armored combat or battle vehicle, not armored struggle vehicle.  The German word for the sport of boxing is likewise "Kampf." In the context of <em>Mein Kampf</em>, the choice of “My Struggle” or “My Battle” - or "Fight" - carries significant connotations.  
   <p>Hitler and the Nazis, who commonly used military language, saw themselves fighting and battling to restore German greatness, to free Germany from the Versailles treaty, and to overcome “the Jews.”  In the English language, “struggle” can convey a meaning quite different from battle or fight.   For example, a baseball batter who is “battling” at the plate is successfully fighting off tough pitches until finding one to drive for a hit or a home run.  A batter who is “struggling,” by contrast, is in a slump.  While portions of <em>Mein Kampf</em> describe Hitler’s rise from his struggling early years of life, the bulk of the book is about his fight as the leader of the Nazi movement.  The title “My Battle” better captures the aggressive Nazi spirit of the book.  The common translation “My Struggle” may capture that spirit as well, if it is understood primarily as a struggle for power or a struggle of life and death.
   <p>Further nuances of translation appear in the passage of <em>Mein Kampf</em> about the mission of the Nazi Party, quoted in this section from page 452 of Manheim’s translation.  The term “creative work” could also be rendered “productive work,” as an alternative translation of the German adjective <em>schaffend</em>.  Hitler’s antisemitic propaganda from September 1919 onward attacked Jews universally as financial parasites profiteering off the productive labor of others.  The gravamen of his antisemitic smear was not lack of creativity in the common English use of that term.
   <a name="swastikamission"></a><p>The original German of Hitler's passage about the meaning of the swastika reads:

<blockquote>"die Mission des Kampfes für den Sieg des arischen Menschen und zugleich mit ihm auch den Sieg des Gedankens der schaffenden Arbeit, die selbst ewig antisemitisch war und antisemitisch sein wird."</blockquote>

<p>The phrase “always has been and always will be anti-Semitic” could describe either the noun “work” or the noun “mission,” given the rules of German grammar.  It is unclear how the productive work of a laborer is antisemitic, but the character and conduct of the Nazi Party were indeed antisemitic, the earliest years of the Nazi movement. Thus "antisemitic" in this passage of <em>Mein Kampf</em> logically describes "mission."
   <p>The purpose of paying attention to such nuances is not to assert superiority over a translator of <em>Mein Kampf</em> whose translation has held up well over the years, but rather to call attention to the issues that sometimes lurk under the surface of German-English translation, or any translation.  For the passage about the mission of the Nazi Party, quoted from the Manheim translation of <em>Mein Kampf</em>, the original German reads as follows:
“die Mission des Kampfes für den Sieg des arischen Menschen und zugleich auch mit ihm den Sieg des Gedankens der schaffenden Arbeit, die selbst ewig antisemitisch war und antisemitisch sein wird.”
     <p>For Hitler, Jewish people were the opposites and enemies of the “Aryan man” of this passage.  “The Jews constitute the most powerful antithesis to the Aryans.”  (<em>Mein Kampf</em>, vol. I, ch. 11)   Hitler denied that his hatred of the Jews, expressed at great length in <em>Mein Kampf</em>, had anything to do with religion.  “The Jews have always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a religion.”  Hitler equated Judaism with Communism, but also with constitutional democracy, especially parliamentary democracy as it existed in Germany after World War I.  <em>Mein Kampf</em> referred accordingly to “the Jews in their Marxist and democratic press.”  (vol. I, ch. 10)</p><br>

<a name="collaborators"></a><p><u>collaborators</u>: Although there is no definitive historical assessment of who wrote what parts of <em>Mein Kampf</em>, it is clear that Hitler was not capable of writing the book himself.  He was assisted by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, by Catholic priest Bernhard Stempfle, and perhaps by others. Hitler wrote very little over the course of his life. His early writings, before he had assistance from fellow Nazis and sympathizers, show extremely limited ability to express ideas beyond basic accounts of his day-to-day activities.</p><br> 

<a name="i108"></a><p><u>provisional regulation</u>:  The original text can be found at the <a href="http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/flaggen.html">German online document archive</a>:

<blockquote>“Decree of the Reich President on the Provisional Regulation of Flag Hoisting”
   <p>Upon this day when, throughout Germany, the old black-white-red flags fly at half-mast to honor our war dead, I order that from tomorrow until a final regulation of the Reich colors, the black-white-red flag and the swastika flag shall be hoisted together.  These flags connect the glorious past of the German Reich with the vigorous rebirth of the German Nation.  Together they shall embody the power of the State and the inner agreement of all national elements of the German <em>Volk</em>!
   <p>Military installations will hoist only the Reich War Flag.
<p>Berlin, March 12, 1933.
<p>Signed:
<p>Reich President von Hindenburg
<p>Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler</blockquote><br>

<h4>Historical Context: Argentina</h4>

The German ambassador to the Vatican, Diego von Bergen, reported on the conflict between the Vatican and the Argentine government.  A general history of the Catholic Church in Argentina is John J. Kennedy’s <em>Catholicism, Nationalism, and Democracy in Argentina</em> (University of Notre Dame Press, 1958).

I, ch. 11)   Hitler denied that his hatred of the Jews, expressed at great length in <em>Mein Kampf</em>, had anything to do with religion.  “The Jews have always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a religion.”  Hitler equated Judaism with Communism, but also with constitutional democracy, especially parliamentary democracy as it existed in Germany after World War I.  <em>Mein Kampf</em> referred accordingly to “the Jews in their Marxist and democratic press.”  (vol. I, ch. 10)</p><br>

   <p>Upon this day when, throughout Germany, the old black-white-red flags fly at half-mast to honor our war dead, I order that from tomorrow until a final regulation of the Reich colors, the black-white-red flag and the swastika flag shall be hoisted together.  These flags connect the glorious past of the German Reich with the vigorous rebirth of the German Nation.  Together they shall embody the power of the State and the inner agreement of all national elements of the German <em>Volk</em>!

<h4>Historical Context: Argentina</h4>

<a name="i109"></a><p><u>protested</u>:  We discovered this issue in the “Vatikan” file of the German Foreign Office archive in Berlin.  The German ambassador to the Vatican, Diego von Bergen, reported on the conflict between the Vatican and the Argentine government.  A general history of the Catholic Church in Argentina is John J. Kennedy’s <em>Catholicism, Nationalism, and Democracy in Argentina</em> (University of Notre Dame Press, 1958).

 
<h4>A Reality, Not a Fabrication</h4>

<a name="i110"></a><p><u>International Eucharistic Congress</u>:  These events were held annually from 1881 until the First World War, every other year in the 1920s and 1930s, occasionally in the 1950s (twice), and every four years from the 1960s to today.  Diane Galebach attended the 42nd International Eucharistic Congress in 1981 at Lourdes, France.  Eucharistic Congresses focus on traditional Catholic devotion to Jesus present in the Eucharist, the Sacrament of Holy Communion, as understood from Scriptures such as Luke 22:14-30 and I Corinthians 11:17-34.  One does not expect to see political party flags, or controversial flags of any sort, honored at Eucharistic Congresses.   This is a picture of the scene in Buenos Aires on October 11, 1934, when over 100,000 children received Holy Communion.
 

<a name="i111"></a><p><u>Santiago Luis Copello</u>:  Archbishop Copello was the first Argentine Bishop chosen unilaterally by the Vatican.  Catholics today are accustomed to Bishops being chosen by the Pope, typically with input from the Vatican Nuncio, with staff work performed by a Vatican congregation, typically under direction of a Cardinal, together with the Vatican Secretariat of State.  When the Diocese of Buenos Aires was created in the early 1600s, however, Catholic Bishops throughout the realm of the King of Spain, including his colonies, were chosen by the King under his traditional right of <em>patronado</em>, or patronage, over the Catholic Church.  The King’s chosen candidate was then installed or invested with the agreement of the Pope.  When Argentina became independent of Spain in the early 1800s, the Vatican, after a more than decade-long vacancy in the Bishopric of Buenos Aires, allowed the right of <em>patronado</em> to pass to the Argentine Government.  A turning point occurred during the 1920s, under Pope Pius XI.  When Archbishop Espinosa of Buenos Aires died in 1923, the Argentine Government pursued its traditional selection process and chose the Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires, Miguel De Andrea, as Archbishop.  To the surprise and consternation of the Argentines, the Vatican refused to install De Andrea.  After more than two years of deadlock, the two sides settled upon a new Archbishop agreeable to both, a Franciscan friar.  Shortly thereafter, again to the surprise of the Argentine Government, the Vatican unilaterally chose Santiago Luis Copello as a new Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1928.  Copello had previously become Auxiliary Bishop of La Plata through the traditional process.  Although the Argentine Government protested the Vatican’s departure from traditional selection procedure, Copello became Auxiliary Bishop.  Also in 1928, Copello became the Apostolic Vicar for the Argentine military, meaning that he was in charge of military chaplains and had high level interaction with the military command structure.  Four years later, the Franciscan friar resigned as Archbishop at age 72 for “health reasons,” and Bishop Copello was appointed Archbishop by the Vatican two months later, in October 1932.  This is a promotional picture of Archbishop Copello that appeared in a special edition that the glossy Argentine magazine <em>Caras y Caretas</em> dedicated to the International Eucharistic Congress:
 

<a name="i112"></a><p><u>Baron Edmund von Thermann</u>:  Thermann was a career diplomat who distinguished himself from his fellow professional hold-overs from the Weimar Republic by his enthusiastic devotion to the Nazi cause.  He arrived in Buenos Aires attired in his SS officer uniform and sang a Nazi anthem with fellow Nazis who welcomed him at the pier.  Thermann set about cajoling and pressuring all the German educational, social, business and other associations in Argentina to come into line with Nazi Germany.  Details of his efforts, aided greatly by his wife’s attentions to female German ex-patriates, are recounted in a German historian’s study of Nazism in Latin America, focusing on the Overseas Organization of the Nazi Party in Argentina.  Jürgen Müller, <em>Nationalsozialismus in Lateinamerika: Die Auslandsorganisation der NSDAP in Argentinien, Brasilien, Chile und Mexiko</em> [The Overseas Organization of the Nazi Party in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico] (1997).  Thermann’s reputation as an enthusiastic Nazi in Argentina is described by American historian Ronald Newton in <em>The “Nazi Menace” in Argentina, 1931-1947</em> (1992).  Several months before heading to Argentina in late 1933 as German Ambassador, Thermann received a commission as an officer in the SS.  This is how the Baron looked in a German military officer dress uniform, equivalent to Mess Dress with a Boat Cloak in traditional U.S. Marine Corps usage:
 

<a name="i113"></a><p><u>pendants</u>:   The Nazis used pendants on swastika flags in a manner similar to military usage with pendants on unit flags.  In American usage, for instance, if a unit such as the 4th Marine Regiment earns a service campaign award, a pendant is added to the regimental flag.  The color scheme and pattern of the pendant match that of the ribbons or medals worn by the individual Marines of that regiment who participated in the campaign.  The Nazi Party varied the traditions of military usage during the 1920s by placing pendants on some Nazi flags that related to matters like the Versailles Treaty or the 1923 putsch, which the Nazis desired to overcome or memorialize.  It is not known what type of pendants were attached to the Nazi flag that Archbishop Copello blessed.   

<a name="i114"></a><p><u>Carlos Saavedra Lamas</u>:  Argentine Foreign Minister 1932-1938; Vice President of the International Eucharistic Congress, 1934.   Saavedra Lamas can be recognized by his moustache in many group photographs from the time of the Eucharistic Congress.   Here he is accompanying Archbishop Copello to a blessing of the new building of the National Press Club of Argentina two months before the Eucharistic Congress:

<h4>The Meaning of the Swastika to Argentines in 1934</h4>

<a name="i115"></a><p><u>text and headlines</u>:  Here is the translation of each of the four articles shown in the photograph.  An article from the Buenos Aires daily <em>La Nacion</em> follows, as a further representative sample from the German Embassy files.
<p>"Concerning the Hoisting of Flags, the Executive Authority of the Province of Buenos Aires Explained” (<em>El Pais</em>, Cordoba, July 13, 1934) - Dateline:  La Plata, July 12.
   <blockquote>Because of an inquiry submitted by police headquarters, the Executive Authority, by means of the Ministry of Government, has made it known that, in accordance with decrees enacted by the national government regulating the display of the flag, display of flags jointly with the Argentine flag is only authorized for the flags of foreign countries with which the Republic maintains friendly relations, requiring the prevention of hoisting of those that are not in this category.
   <p>In the preamble of the resolution, it is stated that the inquiry was submitted in reference to a particular locality where a swastika cross was displayed jointly with another flag, citing the point that the regulation of national symbols pertains to the government of the Nation and not to the provincial authorities, who are to implement the provisions contained in various decrees concerning the display of the flag.</blockquote><br>

<p>“The Nazi Flag Is the Symbol Not of a Nation but of a Party:  Its Presence in our Country, Says a Reader, Profanes Our Streets” (<em>Critica</em>, Buenos Aires, July 15, 1934)
   <blockquote>Reflecting a state of mind that I take to be widespread, and responding to a current event, concerning the prohibition by Dr. Rodolfo Moreno, Minister of the Provincial Government, of the display of the swastika flag in the entire province, we are publishing a letter that was sent to <em>Critica</em>, which contains commentary that deserves to reach our readers:
   <p>Among the German Nazis ... in Buenos Aires – and among them there are quite a few who have not been removed from the lists of the Party because it has its local seat in the same German Embassy – the decision of the Ministry of the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires, Dr. Rodolfo Moreno, prohibiting the display of the swastika in the entire territory of the Province, has been passionately discussed.  It is argued that the swastika is the flag of the German nation.  It should be highlighted that it was officially established in 1924 as the flag of the Nazi Party.  By Hitler’s decree, the swastika was made official in the early weeks of the past year, but international law does not recognize the decrees that emanate from authorities that are not constitutionally legislated bodies.  Therefore, the Nazi cross should not and cannot be recognized abroad as the symbol of German sovereignty, but only, consequently, as signifying a partisan flag.  It is not amiss to note that the swastika remains the emblem of the Nazi Party, which is a very different matter from the German people and nation.
   <p>If humanly speaking it can be understood that some German fanatics are fooled by Hitler’s grandiloquence, it is right to believe that the aspect of the Argentine street is profaned by exhibiting the cross of the confessed murderer of 77 of his friends, the result of which is not only intolerable but extremely pernicious  for the good name of the Argentines, among whom are three generals of our national army who attended a party of German Argentine adventurers, where homage was rendered to this flag and where the Horst Wessel Song was sung, the sanguinary partisan song of Hitlerism.</blockquote><br> 

<p>“Efforts for Prohibition of the Nazi Flag: The Directors of Accion Argentina Submitted a Request to the Interior Minister:  Reasons Disclosed” (<em>El Diario</em>, Buenos Aires, July 15, 1934)
   <blockquote>In the last meeting of the Executive Committee of Accion Argentina, it was resolved to address the Interior Minister, requesting that, in accordance with the decree of April 28, 1933 given by the Executive Authority, the display of the Nazi flag be prohibited in the entire territory of the nation.
   <p>In accordance with this decree – they state – the national flag can only be displayed with flags of countries with which our country maintains relations.  This flag, whose display is requested to be prohibited, is not that of any nation, but rather represents a political idea of a portion of the German people in which our fatherland has no interest, and whose display could lead to internal unrest by its professed ideology, which is to be prevented by good governance.
   <p>Accion Argentina, a patriotic institution that aspires to a reign of peace and harmony emanating from the faith of our ancestors, adopts this resolution considering that, in the days of the celebration of the anniversary of our political independence, various Nazi flags have been hoisted.</blockquote><br>

<p>“Request for the Prohibition of the Display of a Flag: The Nazi [Flag] Represents a Political Idea that is of No Interest Here” (<em>El Liberal</em>, Santiago del Estero, July 15, 1934)
<p>[no text visible]</p><br>
   <p>The following is an article from the Buenos Aires daily <em>La Nacion</em> of July 13, 1934, found among the clippings in the German Embassy files:
 
<p>“The Display of the ‘Nazi’ Flag in the Province of Buenos Aires: Issuance of a Decree by the Governing Ministry in Response to an Inquiry” - Dateline:  La Plata, July 12, 1934
   <blockquote>A decree has been issued by the Government Ministry, informing police headquarters that according to provisions contained in the decrees of April 28, July 8, and November 7,1933, issued by the national government, regulating the display of flags, it is only authorized to hoist with the Argentine flag the flags of foreign nations with which the Republic maintains friendly relations, requiring the prohibition of any other foreign symbol.
   <p>The decree is based on an inquiry submitted by police headquarters about the procedure to be adopted with reference to the display of flags on patriotic anniversaries and because of the hoisting in a particular locality, along with Argentine and German flags, another with the swastika cross.  In the preamble it says that the regulation of the display of national symbols pertains to the national government and not to the provinces, and that the national Executive Authority, in the decree of April 28, 1933, prohibited “in public meetings, assemblies, demonstrations and parades, the display of other flags than the Argentine and those of foreign nations with which the Republic maintains friendly relations.”  Additionally, in that same decree, it is specified that the provincial governments, as the natural agents of the federal government in their respective territories, are responsible for its implementation. 
   <p>The following is the article from <em>La Vanguardia</em> as we found it in the files of the German Embassy to Argentina, maintained today in the archives of the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
 
   <p>The German typing above the clipping reads as follows:
<blockquote>The Government has promulgated a decree in this regard.
<p>La Plata, July 12 – The Province today informed the police, by the decree, that they must confiscate flags whose display is not authorized by the applicable laws of the national government.
<p>This measure is the result of flags with the swastika of German fascism being displayed on various houses on July 9th of this year.
<p>As a result, the police will have such flags taken in if they are displayed in public.</blockquote>

<a name="i116"></a><p><u>documents</u>:  In the days following the spate of articles across Argentina in mid-July 1934 about the prohibition of the swastika flag in the Province of Buenos Aires, documents in the German Embassy file show a concerted effort to change the situation.  The following is the text of a draft memorandum that was prepared for transmission to Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas on July 18, 1934, translated from the original Spanish.
 
   <blockquote>The enclosed clippings show that the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires has issued a decree concerning display of flags, in which, according to the opinion of the said newspapers, it would be prohibited to hoist the flag with the swastika cross jointly with the national flag.
   
<p>The German Embassy has the honor to ... be permitted to make reference to its note of April 22, 1933, No. 214 (to which the Ministry responded on the 26th of the same month), which note communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Relations that the German flag is composed of two, the black-white-red and the swastika cross, which should be hoisted jointly.</blockquote>
   
<p>Red pencil marking at the bottom of the memorandum indicates that it was hand-delivered to Carlos Saavedra Lamas by Thermann on July 19. 
   
<p>A letter from Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas to the German Embassy said that the anti-swastika decree of the Government of Buenos Aires Province would have no effect [<em>nada afecta</em>] on the display of the swastika flag, thus indicating that the federal government of Argentina would allow swastika flags to be displayed with the German imperial tricolor.  A red pencil question mark to the right of <em>nada afecta</em> indicates Thermann’s uncertainty about the effect of this memorandum.  It does not appear that this memorandum or a countermanding of the Buenos Aires Provincial Government’s anti-swastika decree was publicized in the Argentine press.

 
<p>Source:  <em>Flaggenfrage</em> file, vol. 3, German Embassy to Argentine, German Foreign Office Archive, Berlin.

   <p>The German Embassy’s efforts to persuade Argentine authorities that the swastika was the co-joint national flag ran counter to the widespread and correct understanding in Argentina that the swastika flag was the flag of the Nazi Party.  The Nazis themselves continued to treat the swastika flag as their Party flag after the 1933 flag decree.  For example, in images from the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, the public buildings of Nuremberg are bedecked with tandem displays of German imperial tricolors and swastika flags, but in the arena where the Nazi Party events take place, large numbers of swastika flags are displayed without the imperial tricolor.  This aspect can be seen in the propaganda movie that was filmed at the Congress, <em>Triumph of the Will.</em>  
   <p>Argentines had witnessed earlier controversies about the German flag in the aftermath of World War One, when the Weimar Republic adopted the black-gold-red tricolor of the 1848 democratic revolutionary movement.  Some German expatriates in the early 1920s expressed their disapproval of the Weimar Republic, and their continuing loyalty to the deposed Kaiser, by flying the black-white-red tricolor in Argentina on German patriotic holidays.  Those German ex-pats encountered the same prohibition that confronted the swastika in 1934, namely the Argentine law allowing display only of the national flags of nations with friendly relations with Argentina.  
   <p>The Weimar black-gold-red tricolor once again became the flag of Germany after World War II.</p><br>

   <p>In common parlance today, the terms Vatican and Holy See are interchangeable.  “How to Cover the Catholic Church,” U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Office of Media Relations.
    <p>The term “Vatican” refers equally to (1) the head of the Roman Catholic Church, called the Pope, the Holy Father, or the Pontiff, together with his staff or “Curia”; (2) the walled area of 100+ acres in Rome containing St. Peter’s Basilica, offices, museum, gardens, and residence into which the Pope moved when Italy took over the rest of Rome in 1870; and (3) the Vatican City State created by treaty with Mussolini in 1929.
     <p>The term “Holy See” is often used to refer to the Pope and Curia (Latin for royal court), both in their governance of the Catholic Church and in their governance of the Vatican City State.  A “see” is a bishop’s seat, and the see of Rome is deemed “holy” by its association with Peter, the pre-eminent apostle among Jesus’ apostles, who, according to early Church tradition, was crucified in Rome.

<h4>The Swastika at a Pontifical Mass</h4>

<a name="i119"></a><p><u>path-breaking study</u>:  Graciela Ben-Dror’s <em>Catolicos, Judios y Nazis</em> [Catholics, Jews and Nazis] (2003), which exists also in the Hebrew original and in English translation as <em>The Catholic Church and the Jews: Argentina</em> (2008), acknowledges that the writer was breaking a taboo in Argentina against historical study of the antisemitic transformation of the country in the 1930s and following.  Ben-Dror’s further study of the Catholic Church before the Holocaust in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Spain provides extensive detail of developments in these individual countries.  <em>La Iglesia Catolica ante el Holocausto: Espana y América Latina, 1933-1945</em> [The Catholic Church before the Holocaust: Spain and Latin America] (2003).

<a name="i120"></a><p><u>antisemitism</u>:  The term “antisemitism” first came to be used in Germany in the late 1870s (<em>Antisemitismus</em> in German), by the first publisher of an antisemitic best-seller in Germany, Wilhelm Marr.  His pamphlet <em>The Victory of Judaism over Germanism</em> went through 12 editions in its first year, 1879.  Marr followed with a periodical, <em>Deutsche Wache</em> [German Watch or Watchman], which he started in October 1879, and the subsequent founding of the Antisemitenliga [Antisemites League].  Jacob Katz, <em>From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933</em> (1997), p.260.

<a name="i122"></a><p><u>Vatican Secretary of State</u>:  The Secretary of State is the most important member of the Pope’s staff, or Curia.  Reporting directly to the Pope, he handles diplomatic and political matters worldwide.  The Vatican’s ambassadors, Nuncios, report to him, and he deals regularly with the ambassadors of countries that have diplomatic relations with the Vatican.  The Secretary of State plays a large part in the selection of bishops.  His role involves both matters of internal governance of the Catholic Church and matters concerning relations with foreign governments.  Before Cardinal Pacelli’s time, the head of the Vatican’s “Holy Office,” in charge of doctrinal matters, was sometimes co-equal or superior to the Secretary of State. 
   <p>The Vatican’s website describes the Secretary of State’s role:  “As the Pope’s first collaborator in the governance of the universal Church, the Cardinal Secretary of State is the one primarily responsible for the diplomatic and political activity of the Holy See.”

<a name="i124"></a><p><u>21-gun salute</u>:  The Argentine Government, following diplomatic protocol for a <em>Legate a Latere</em>, gave Cardinal Pacelli the salute due to a head of state, delivered by the guns of the Argentine Navy.  Pope Pius XI had become a head of state in 1929, by means of the Lateran Treaty, by which Mussolini recognized the sovereignty of the Vatican City State, also known as the Holy See.  The Papal States had been a sovereign principality extending northeast across the Italian peninsula from the regions surrounding Rome to the area around Bologna, until the Italian unification movement took control of the central and northern portions in 1860, the provinces near Rome in the mid-1860s, and Rome itself in September 1870.  
   <p>The Argentine press covered the details of imperial ceremony welcoming Cardinal Pacelli to Buenos Aires, from the pictures of the Argentine naval vessels that fired the 21-gun salute, to the procession in open horse-drawn carriage to the Cathedral.  A photograph of the ships appeared in the glossy Argentine magazine <em>Caras y Caretas</em> on October 13, 1934.

<a name="i125"></a><p><u>world renowned peace advocate</u>:  Carlos Saavedra Lamas played an extraordinary role in world affairs during the 1930s.  A professor and expert in labor law and international law, he served as Argentine Foreign Minister from 1932 to 1938.  Though appointed by a general who had come to power as the result of a coup followed by rigged elections, Saavedra was an effective advocate for non-violent means to resolve international disputes.  Within a year of becoming Foreign Minister, he led Argentina back into the League of Nations after a 12-year absence.  In 1935 he successfully mediated an end to the Chacos War between Paraguay and Bolivia.  The following year he was elected President of the Assembly of the League of Nations and received the Nobel Peace Prize.  His most significant and lasting legacy is the Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation, designed by him and signed by South American countries in 1933.  That treaty, with its procedures to resolve disputes by mediation, is a major reason for the relative lack of warfare among South American countries during the past eight decades.</p>

<a name="i127"></a><p><u>elevated to Cardinal</u>:  Copello’s elevation to Cardinal was a conspicuous honor in the Catholic world.  He was the first Argentine to be elevated to Cardinal.  Indeed, in the 400-year history of Catholic Bishops in the Spanish-speaking portion of South America, he was the first ever to become Cardinal.  Copello’s close continuing relationship with Cardinal Pacelli can be seen in this picture from Pacelli’s 1939 coronation at Pope Pius XII, with Copello standing at the right of the papal throne:  
 

<p>In the 12-volume collection of Vatican archival documents published in the 1960s and 1970s, there is an example of a trusted role played by Copello, when the Vatican relied on him to organize Catholic Bishops throughout Latin America to have their governments pressure the Allies to refrain from bombing Axis-occupied Rome.  <em>Actes et Documents du Saint Siège Relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale</em> [Files and Documents of the Holy See Related to the Second World War].  An additional reference to Copello is found in vol. 8, p.628 n.4 (referring to the Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires as “Jaime Luis Copello”).</p><br> 

<a name="i128"></a><p><u>official policy</u> of 1924:  “In the official bulletins the clergy are to be most strongly bound by conscience to reject emphatically from the outset every request for joint masses with Protestants, from whichever side they may arise, and in no way to cooperate with them.  The flags of political organizations are to receive no Church blessing.  Since these two decrees have been made unanimously, petitioners cannot appeal to other Dioceses.”

<a name="i129"></a><p><u>decreed</u>:  This is the February 10, 1931 Pastoral Instruction from the Bavarian Bishops:
<blockquote>Foreword:  From the ranks of the clergy, in recent months, have arisen repeated inquiries to the highest Bishop’s office, asking how they should respond to a request for a Mass on the part of National Socialist groups.  Since the clergy have a right to receive guidelines from their bishops in all pastoral questions, the Bishops of the eight Bavarian dioceses are issuing the following joint instruction.  This instruction issues at a somewhat long remove in time from the electoral campaign [of September 1930], in order to throw into bold relief the unpolitical, purely pastoral character of the instruction.
<p>Main text:  1. National Socialism contains heresies in its cultural policy program, because it rejects or erroneously conceives essential doctrinal points of the Catholic faith and because, according to statements of its leaders, it wants to erect a new ideology in place of Christian faith.  Far be it from us to concern ourselves with the government policy goals of National Socialism; we consider only what position it takes toward Catholic Christianity.
   <p>Leading representatives of National Socialism place race higher than religion.  They reject the revelation of the Old Testament and even the Ten Commandments of Moses.  They do not acknowledge the primacy of the Pope in Rome, because his position is outside Germany, and they toy with the concept of a German national church without dogma.  In section 24 of their Program, the eternally valid Christian moral law is supposed to be tested against the moral sentiment of the Germanic race.  Concepts of a right of revolution, to be accompanied by success, and of the priority of might over right, are in contradiction to Christian social teaching.  It can be established from previous proclamations of the Party or Party leaders that:  What National Socialism calls Christianity is no longer the Christianity of Christ.  Therefore the Bishops, as guardians of the Church’s doctrine on faith and morals, must give warnings about National Socialism for so long and so far as it proclaims culture-policy views that are not compatible with Catholic doctrine.
   <p>2.  For Catholic priests it is strictly forbidden to cooperate in the National Socialist movement in any manner whatsoever.  To Catholic priests, who are capable of distinguishing dogma from heresy on the strength of their theological training, the anti-Christian and anti-Church principles and phenomena of this movement cannot be unknown, such as the rejection of every concordat, the promotion of the inter-denominational school, the radicalism of the nationalist concept, the resistance to protecting embryonic human life.  Priests cannot assume that an erring conscience is without guilt.  For the same reason, pastors of souls have a duty to explain to the people in a calm objective tone that National Socialism, originally a government-policy movement directed against Marxism, has swung in the course of recent years more and more into the culture-policy realm and thereby has ended up in a culture-war [<em>Kulturkampf</em>] posture against the Church and its Bishops.  In the leading newspapers of this Party a tone has been struck against Catholic proclamations, even the appeal of the Holy Father for defense against Bolshevism, that is bereft of all expert knowledge in theological questions and bereft of all reverence.
   <p>3.  The participation of National Socialists at liturgical events in closed ranks with uniforms and flags is and remains forbidden, because such a Church parade would give the people the impression that the Church had come to terms with National Socialism.  If an individual National Socialist shows up in church with the insignia of his Party, that can only go uncorrected if there is a prospect of a demonstration or a disturbance of religious observances.
<p>4.  As to the question whether a National Socialist can be admitted to the holy sacraments of confession and communion, it is to be judged from case to case whether the person concerned is a fellow traveler of the movement who has not taken account of the religious and culture-policy goals of the movement, or whether he, as a political representative, as a writer, or as an agent has stood behind the entire goals of his Party, thus also for those points that are not in conformity with the nature of Christianity and with the doctrinal teaching of the Church...</blockquote>

(“We encounter statements that stand in sharpest opposition to Catholic teaching on faith and morals, full of invective against the Catholic Church and her beliefs, against Sacred Scripture ... In this sense the swastika is the symbol of the struggle against the Cross of Christ.”)</p><br>

<a name="i131"></a><p><u>resulting publicity</u> concerning Mainz:  The public stand taken by the Catholic Diocese of Mainz in 1931, denying the sacraments to Catholics who joined the Nazi Party, illustrates the impact of strong Catholic leadership against Nazism in the period before the Nazis came to power.  It belongs among the stories of “what might have been.”

   <p>The Diocese of Mainz, a city along the Rhine River about midway along its south-north course through Germany, issued a clear instruction to the faithful in 1930 against joining the Nazi Party.  Anyone who became a card-carrying member was forbidden to receive the sacraments, in effect, excommunicated.  The Nazi <em>Gauleiter</em> of the German state of Hesse, Peter Gemeinder, was a Catholic who attended mass, whose wife was a member of a Catholic women’s association, and whose two sons were altar servers.  When he suddenly died of a heart attack at the end of August 1931, his family requested a Catholic funeral and burial.  The Vicar General of the Diocese of Mainz, which included the Gemeinders’ home town of Darmstadt and other parts of Hesse, in conjunction with the Diocesan “Ordinariate” enforced the 1930 instruction and refused to allow a Catholic service.  The Mainz Ordinariate reflected a traditional form of local Catholic Church organization that is virtually unknown today.  It included Bishop Ludwig Maria Hugo and a Vicar General, but also Cathedral “canons” and other priests, who made important decisions collegially, including the selection of the new Bishop upon the passing away of the old.

   <p>An examination of the Nazi Party’s newspaper, the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em> [<em>Völkisch</em> Observer], finds a series of six articles and features about Gemeinder from September 3 to 8, 1931, portraying him as a model Nazi leader.  The same issues contain a series of articles focused on the Catholic Church, including the Vatican’s recent agreement with Mussolini about the role of Catholic Action in Italy, and a group of Catholic priests favorable to Nazism.  On September 8th the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em> expanded upon its September 5th notice that the Bishop of Mainz had denied a Catholic funeral for Gemeinder.  The paper proceeded to make a major issue of that denial, publishing a series of more than a dozen articles over the next month about the “results of Mainz” and Catholics leaving the Church.

   <p>But the flagship newspaper of the Catholic Center Party, <em>Germania</em>, took a strong stand at the same time, arguing for a nationwide application of the Mainz policy.  In an article on September 10, 1931 entitled “Konsequenzen,” <em>Germania</em> explained that Gemeinder had suffered the “consequences” of joining a movement contrary to Catholicism and disobeying a clear order from Church authority.  If the Nazis want to use the occasion to launch an attack on the Catholic Church, <em>Germania</em> continued, that will only “create decisive clarity that between the doctrines of Adolf Hitler and the doctrines of the Catholic Church; common ground is unthinkable.”

   <p>The danger of the Mainz policy and its potential impact on the Nazi Party nationwide prompted Hitler’s press chief, Otto Dietrich, to write an urgent appeal to Hitler two days later, on September 12, urging a PR counter-offensive.  Openly admitting the high-risk stakes involved, Dietrich proposed that Hitler publicly challenge the Diocese of Mainz for being out of step with Vatican policy and inconsistent with the position of Pope Pius XI.  There is evidence, as we will see, that the Nazi Party followed this approach several weeks later in the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>.  While Dietrich acknowledged the danger that he Vatican might call Hitler’s bluff and voice its support for the Bishop of Mainz, Dietrich’s prediction that the Vatican would not do so proved correct.

   <p>On the same day, September 12, the Vatican Nunciature in Berlin sent Cardinal Pacelli a memorandum about the controversy, enclosing a clipping of <em>Germania’s</em> “Konsequenzen” article, and acknowledging that Cardinal Pacelli had been following the issue in the German press. 
 
  <p>On October 5, 1931, the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em> published its most aggressive counter-attack on the Bishop of Mainz, under the headline “Religious Terror in Mainz.”  Strikingly, the article quotes provisions of Catholic Church Canon Law against the Bishop of Mainz.  This article too was clipped and sent to Cardinal Pacelli, as appears in microfilm of documents from the Vatican Archives available the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC.  <em>Selected Records from the Vatican Archives 1865-1939</em>, US Holocaust Memorial Museum, Record Group 76.001, Reel 12, Pos. 621, Fasc. 139.

   <p>In the months that followed, conferences of Catholic Bishops in Germany, including Bavaria, the Cologne region, and the Paderborn region, issued pastoral statements against Nazism.  Some of these are cited in the main text, including the statement of the Bishops of the Paderborn province in their denunciation of the swastika.  The German Bishops’ statements in 1931 and 1932, however, varied from the Mainz policy in three significant respects.  First, they criticized Nazism only “so far and so long” as it contravened Catholic doctrine and opposed the Catholic Church, a contingent statement that allowed room for change if the Nazis offered concessions.  Second, in the course of forbidding Catholics to join the Nazi Party, they did not threaten excommunication, nor in fact did any other German Bishop proceed to take such a strict enforcement stance as the Bishop of Mainz.  Third, they did not mention antisemitism as an objectionable Nazi tenet.

   <p>Mainz was the only Catholic Diocese, as far as we have found, that cited antisemitism as one of the objectionable tenets of Nazism.  In a statement of September 16, 1931 explaining the Mainz policy, Vicar General Mayer stated that Nazi antisemitism was a violation of the Vatican doctrinal decree of March 25, 1928.  <em>Mainzer Journal</em>, Sept. 16, 1931, reprinted in Sigrid Duchhardt-Bösken, ed., <em>Das Bischöfliche Ordinariat Mainz und der Nationalsozialismus bis 1933: Eine Dokumentation</em> [The Mainz Diocese Ordinariate and National Socialism up to 1933: A Documentation] (1983).  The Vatican decree of March 25, 1928 condemned “that hatred toward the children of Israel which is commonly called antisemitism.”

   <p>Disclosures from the Vatican Secret Archives over the past decade have called into question whether that decree was intended to be enforced, or was intended rather to ward off criticism as the Vatican suppressed, on March 25, 1928, the leading Catholic association then taking a public stand against antisemitism. See Fr. Hubert Wolf, <em>Pope and Devil</em> (2010). It appears that Bishop Hugo of Mainz received no support for his stand against Nazi antisemitism, whether from his brother Bishops in Germany or from any authoritative voice in Rome.
 
  <p>The following are translations of the documents mentioned above. 
 
  <p><strong>“Konsequenzen,”</strong> <em>Germania</em>, September 10, 1931
   
<blockquote>“Consequences”
 
  <p>The recently deceased Hessian <em>Gauleiter</em> and Reich parliament representative of the Nazi Party, Peter Gemeinder, has been denied a Church burial by Catholic Church authorities.  The National Socialist press is naturally trying to exploit the Gemeinder case for sharp anti-Church partisan propaganda.  Thus it is necessary to set out the true state of the matter in this case.
   <p>The Diocesan Ordinariate of Mainz, at the beginning of October 1930, issued a well-known, entirely clear instruction, whereby every Catholic is forbidden to be a card-carrying member of the Hitler Party, and whereby a Catholic who is a card-carrying member of the Hitler Party may not be admitted to the sacraments.  Since October 1930, the Nazi Party leadership has not done anything whatsoever to clarify unconditionally its ambiguous culture-policy goals, or to revise in any way the points that are in explicit contradiction to Catholic doctrine.  As a result, the aforementioned instruction remains valid, after as before, and it is totally obvious that inevitable consequences flow from it for the support or non-support by Church authorities for the burial of National Socialists.</blockquote><br>
   <p>The Vicar General of the Mainz Diocese, Fr. Mayer, took a position on the Gemeinder case in the following statement:
   <blockquote>The German Bishops have unanimously condemned National Socialism as a heresy, because it includes provisions in its written and unwritten program that contradict Catholic doctrine.  Therefore no Catholic is allowed to belong to the Nazi Party as a card-carrying member.  Whoever fails to heed this prohibition and joins the party can receive no Church burial unless before death he somehow makes it known that he repents for his disobedience.  The law applies to every Catholic, be he prince or commoner, rich or poor, a representative in parliament or a simple citizen.  Since in the aforementioned case there are no mitigating factors, the law must be strictly carried out.
   <p>In matters of principle, the Church knows no compromise.  Since the National Socialists, for their part, purport to reject all compromise just as decisively, we do not rightly understand why they do not summon up the necessary understanding for the consequences flowing from the Catholic Church and its doctrine.  National Socialists should also be very familiar with the concept of unconditional obedience, to which the Catholic Church obligates its members.  It would mean surrendering the authority of the Church, if its principled position were to be subordinated to the commands of an Adolf Hitler, who orders his people to obey him more than the Bishops.  It is reported from Hesse that the National Socialists there have been responding to the stance of the Mainz Ordinariate by inciting a movement to leave the Church.  Thus far two Nazi Party members have announced their departure from the Catholic Church.  The Nazi Party may, if it considers it good, continue confidently in this way to launch an attack against the Catholic Church.  It will never, with such methods, bring the Church to agree to bend its principled position to accommodate Nazi heresies.  But it may well thereby create decisive clarity that between the doctrines of Adolf Hitler and the doctrines of the Catholic Church, common ground is unthinkable.</blockquote>

<a name="i132"></a><p><u>risky response</u> proposed by Nazi press chief Dietrich to Hitler, Sept. 12, 1931, contained in the following letter and attached proposed public statement:
<p>Letterhead:  Otto Dietrich, Press Office, National Headquarters of the NSDAP

<blockquote>Dear Herr Hitler, 
   <p>The statement of the Vicar General of the Mainz Diocese concerning the burial of our <em>Gauleiter</em> Gemeinder is so unprecedented and will undoubtedly – if it remains totally uncontradicted –  become a <em>fait accompli</em> which the Vatican for its part will certainly not disavow; it is being used for such strong propaganda against us that a statement from us must no longer be held in abeyance.
   <p>Since this provocative Vicar General Mayer undoubtedly planned this in advance – the appended clipping from the <em>Münchener Zeitung</em> is a clear indication of this – I believe the time is right for us to defend against this attack, by undertaking now an offensive that will render this transgression by the Mainz Vicar General ineffective from a propaganda standpoint and will make our own position prevail eventually against all this, while the manner in which we explain the local church's position will make the Vatican less likely to speak up.
   <p>I do not believe that the Vatican itself – after recognition of our declaration, which once again rejects all pronouncements that contradict the doctrinal and moral teachings of the Christian religion – will intervene against us and thereby nail itself down once and for all.  The Church's centuries-long operational policy would be against it.  Nevertheless an intervention by the Vatican against our statement cannot be ruled out and needs to be taken into consideration in our drafting.  I have already presented the accompanying draft to Herr Strasser, who thought it was suitable.
  <p>I ask you to decide whether you consider a statement on our part to be necessary and appropriate at this time, and if you do, to specify the form in which you would like it.
   <p>In the event you consider a statement appropriate, it needs to happen, in my opinion, as soon as possible.
<p>Your most devoted,
<p>Otto Dietrich</blockquote>
<p>The draft public statement to which Dietrich referred reads as follows.
   <blockquote>On the occasion of the denial of a Church burial for the Catholic National Socialist official Gemeinder, the Vicar General of the Diocese of Mainz, Dr. Mayer, has published a declaration in which he states:  “The German bishops have unanimously condemned National Socialism as a heresy, because it includes in its program written and unwritten propositions that contradict Catholic teaching.  Therefore no Catholic is allowed to belong to the NSDAP as a card-carrying member.”
   <p>Compared to previous conditional positions of the German Bishops concerning National Socialism, this position represents a decidedly positive development.
   <p>The previous position of the German bishops is summed up in the well-known statement of the Bavarian episcopacy, which was adopted by nearly all the German bishops: “The bishops must, as guardians of Church doctrine and moral teaching, warn against National Socialism, for so long and insofar as it proclaims culture-policy views which are incompatible with Catholic teaching.”
   <p>Since the NSDAP has never proclaimed any such culture-policy views, the bishops' denunciations, which expressly rely on the supposition of such proclamations in their warnings against National Socialism, have absolutely nothing to do with National Socialism as it is defined in the NSDAP party program and by its Führer, Adolf Hitler, who, in the final analysis, is the only one who can represent the movement.  If point 24 of the NSDAP party program is described as incompatible with Catholic teaching in various denunciations from the hierarchy, then it is a question here of a formal theological exegesis and interpretation that falsely expounds meaning and content.  Its central part reads: “The party as such advocates the viewpoint of a Positive Christianity without affiliating itself with a particular denomination or confession.” 
   <p>It is self-evident that National Socialism, a purely political movement and true <em>Volk</em> community, which numbers in its ranks members of all denominations, does not intrude upon the freedom of conscience of its political comrades-in-arms and accordingly cannot be made responsible for their purely private expressions.  National Socialism knows, in contrast to other parties, how to keep politics and religion separated.  The type of private expressions of National Socialist party members of various denominations that are characterized as heretical “declarations” from our ranks, cannot with any semblance of justice be laid to the charge of the party, which has expressly rejected to the utmost all declarations that contradict the doctrinal and moral teachings of any Christian religion.
   <p>In light of these clear facts, the previous denunciations by the German bishops in reality signify nothing more than an illustration of the incontestable fact that there is no reason whatsoever – on grounds of any sort of infallible doctrinal decision – for describing the NSDAP as contradicting Catholic doctrinal and moral teachings.  In fact the Pope has never made any decision of the sort.
   <p>Nevertheless the Vicar General of the Diocese of Mainz has now, for the first time, with reference to an “unwritten program” of the NSDAP, made the positive assertion that no Catholic is allowed to belong to the NSDAP.  Yet this denunciation – however clearly set forth – cannot concern the relationship of the NSDAP with the Catholic Church.  First, it concerns a proclamation which is effective – if at all – only within the authority of the Diocese of Mainz.  And second, every Catholic, on the basis of the clear decisions of the Vatican Council, has the right, on the basis of conscience, to ignore the erroneous proclamations of an individual bishop who intrudes in political battles unsupported by any infallible doctrinal decisions.
   <p>In any event, the obviously provocative proceedings of the Vicar General of the Diocese of Mainz have created a situation in which the NSDAP, in the name and in the interest of the many millions of its Catholic supporters, has a responsibility to pose the question of the legitimacy of these statements.  The NSDAP, as the political representative today of at least 10 million voting Germans, who fight under the flag of Adolf Hitler against anti-religious Marxism and Bolshevism, on behalf of freedom and true Christianity, has a right to know whether Vicar General Dr. Mayer, in his unprecedented battle against the NSDAP, is acting in agreement with and by authority of the highest Church authorities, or whether his statement, which represents an intolerable intervention in politics, has been undertaken without respect for the position of the Pope as the holder of the highest doctrinal office of the Catholic Church.    Unless and until such a clarification is made, the NSDAP considers the denunciation by Vicar General Mayer on the relationship of the NSDAP with the Catholic Church to be entirely unauthoritative; the NSDAP advises its millions of Catholic supporters as to their right and their duty to reject, once and for all, every political browbeating by unauthorized Church officials who place themselves in opposition to the position of the Catholic Church, and that all Catholics remain free in the realm of universal Church law to belong to any party they wish.</blockquote>

<a name="i133"></a><p><u>pressure mounted</u>:  Various historians have described the pressure from Catholics who wanted to join the Nazi Party, Catholics who wanted to be able to influence the course of the new German Government, those who said the Nazi Party was no longer just a political party but the actual government of the nation, etc.  The effectiveness of pressure can be seen in the abrupt change of position by the head of the German Bishops Conference, Cardinal Bertram, from mid-March 1933 to late March when he presided over the process by which the Bishops dropped their prohibitions on Catholics joining the Nazi Party.</p><br>

<a name="i134"></a><p><u>Documents</u>:  These documents are reprinted, in the original German, in Bernhard Stasiewski, ed., <em>Akten Deutscher Bischöfe über die Lage der Kirche, 1933-1945</em> [German Bishops’ Papers about Church Matters] (1968), cited hereafter as Stasiewski, <em>German Bishops’ Papers</em>.  It is significant that the signatory of the March 29, 1933 joint statement of the German Bishops, withdrawing their prohibitions on Catholics joining the Nazi Party, was not by Cardinal Bertram as head of the German Bishops Conference, but the Bishop of Mainz, Ludwig Hugo.  As noted above, the Mainz Diocese had taken the strongest stance against Catholics who joined the Nazi Party.  No explanation of the unusual March 1933 signatory role of the Bishop of Mainz has been found.</p><br>

<a name="i135"></a><p><u>by all accounts</u>:  Cardinal Pacelli handled German matters personally as Secretary of State, aided by Germans on his staff.  These included his private secretary Robert Leiber, former Catholic Center Party head Ludwig Kaas, and his long-term housekeeper and private secretary Sr. Pascalina Lehnert.  Cardinal Pacelli acted under the authority of Pope Pius XI and generally in harmony with him in matters of Vatican policy toward Germany.  Pacelli was intimately familiar with Church-State matters in Germany, and the important ecclesiastical and political figures of that country, from his dozen years as Vatican Nuncio to Bavaria and the German Reich.  Primary source documents illustrate Cardinal Pacelli’s hands-on role with respect to German matters as Secretary of State in the 1930s.  He was the signatory on almost all of the dozens of Vatican diplomatic notes to the German Government.  He handled the negotiations for the Vatican-Germany Concordat in 1933, with assistance from Ludwig Kaas.  And British diplomats, among others, considered Cardinal Pacelli to be among the best informed diplomats in Europe.  Ivone Kirkpatrick to Sir Robert Vansittart, August 19, 1933, <em>Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919-1939</em>, 2d Ser. (London, 1956), vol. 5, pp. 524-525.</p><br>

<a name="i136"></a><p><u>made it clear</u>:  Vatican policy was that any matter that was a “<em>causa major</em>” (major issue) with respect to Germany was reserved to the Vatican, and thus was not to be decided or acted upon by the German Bishops.  This reserved category included, at the least, all issues touching upon the Concordat and efforts to implement it.  This Vatican policy was conveyed as early as 1933 by Cardinal Pacelli and Father Kaas to several German Bishops, some in person in Rome, others by telephone call from Kaas to an Archbishop in Germany, who then conveyed the decision to his fellow German Bishops.   Two points are clear from the documents. First, any matter concerning the Concordat was considered a “causa major”for Rome to handle, not the Bishops.  Second, once Rome decided, that was the end of the matter, even if it was a decision by Cardinal Pacelli that was transmitted not in writing, but verbally by Kaas.  Two letters reprinted in Stasiewski’s <em>German Bishops’ Papers</em> illustrate these points:

<p>1.  Bishop Bornewasser of Trier, Germany to Cardinal Bertram, Archbishop of Breslau, Germany and Chairman of the German (Fulda) Bishops Conference, November 24, 1933:

<blockquote>Your Eminence, Reverend Lord Archbishop,
   <p>Upon my return from Rome, where I had gone on account of Saar District matters, I received Your Eminence’s letter.  In response to this letter, I can say the following:
   <p>A letter from von Papen to Bishop Gröber [of Freiburg, Germany] arrived in Rome on Friday of last week.  In this letter von Papen expresses his desire that we bishops take the initiative to lead our young people into the Hitler Youth.  The Bishops of Cologne, Rottenburg, and Trier, who were in Rome at the time, heard from Kaas about this letter.  All three of us spoke up strongly against Papen’s request.  Cardinal Pacelli was immediately informed by Kaas of the letter, which Archbishop Gröber had faithfully sent to Rome without yet having taken any kind of step.  Cardinal Pacelli had Kaas inform Archbishop Gröber by telephone that this had to do with a <em>Causa major</em> [Stasiewski, ed., footnote: referring to Canon Law section 220*), which could only be handled between Rome and Berlin.</blockquote>

<p>*Investigator’s footnote:  The <em>Catholic Encyclopedia</em> of 1909 describes “causa major” as “one of those important matters in which the bishop possesses no authority whatever and which the pope reserves exclusively to himself.”  A.

<p>2.  Archbishop Gröber to Cardinal Bertram, November 24, 1933
<blockquote>Your Eminence, Reverend Lord Archbishop,
   <p>Concerning your esteemed letter of November 22, 1933, I am responding to your position as follows:
   <p>1. It is entirely unknown to me that four German Bishops have agreed to the dissolution of Catholic organizations ...
   <p>3. I have been informed from Rome by telephone that no negotiations may be conducted by the German Bishops on this matter, because it is a question of a Concordat issue, which concerns solely the Holy See and the German Government.  For me that settles the whole matter.  At the same time I emphasize that this is a question that involves not only the Catholic associations but the entire Catholic youth.  I personally have no opinion on the matter, but I can understand if particular Bishops discuss not only the reasons <em>contra</em> dissolution but also <em>pro</em>.  Once Rome has spoken, however, the issue no longer rests with us...</blockquote>

<p>Note:  The ability of Fr. Kaas to give orders to German Bishops in the name of Cardinal Pacelli and to have those orders accepted unquestioningly, as seen in Bishop Bornewasser’s letter to Cardinal Bertram above, was related to Kaas’s long-term work with Nuncio Pacelli in Germany and their long-term friendship.  As seen in the following letter, Kaas let on to at least one German Bishop that he was on a first-name basis with Cardinal Pacelli:

<p>3. Ludwig Kaas to Conrad Gröber, Archbishop of Freiburg, Germany - Rome, December 21, 1933

<blockquote>Dear Friend!
   <p>Heartiest thanks for your good reports.  Also for the letter about the German student group, etc.  Albert’s [Hackelsberger, a Nazi Party member in the Reichstag] visit was very significant in my opinion.  He made his case excellently.  In the very thorough discussion with Eugen [German for Eugenio], such rich and clarifying light was shed on your activity and your fundamental evaluations of the situation and themes, that I was very satisfied with the entire result, which was consistent with your outlook...</blockquote>

<h4>Historical Context: Rome</h4>

<a name="i137"></a><p><u>Nazi pressures to display swastika flags</u>:  It was important for Hitler to gain support for the swastika flag among traditionalist-minded elements of German society, such as the military and the Catholic Church, in order to attain Hitler’s long-unrealized goal of making the swastika the national flag.  The German flag decree of March 1933 was a compromise between Hitler, who wanted to make the swastika the sole national flag, and traditionalists including President Hindenburg and Vice Chancellor Papen, who objected strongly and invoked the memory of the millions of German men who had fought and died under the black-white-red German tricolor.  Papen’s account of the cabinet meeting that adopted the two-flag compromise solution is consistent with the documented result of that meeting:  the flag decree exempted the German military flying the swastika alongside the German war flag, which was the tricolor with an iron cross superimposed.  Franz von Papen, <em>Der Wahrheit Eine Gasse</em> [A Breakthrough of Truth] (1952); English trans. entitled <em>Memoirs</em>, trans. B. Connell (1952).
   <p>British historian John Wheeler-Bennett, who lived in Germany during the last years of the Weimar Republic and the beginning of the Nazi era, described the significance of Hitler’s successful effort in May 1934 to place the swastika on the caps and tunics of the German soldiers and sailors:  “To the soldiers it meant one more obstacle in the way of overthrowing a regime whose insignia they now wore as a part of their own.  In the hearts of those in Germany who had placed their trust in the Army as the last defence of decency in the country, the mounting of the swastika struck a shudder of apprehension and disillusionment.”  <em>The Nemesis of Power</em> (1954), p.313. </p><br>

<a name="i138"></a><p><u>help from the Catholic Vice Chancellor</u>:  On February 19, 1934, the Vatican’s Nuncio to Germany visited the German Foreign Office to complain of Nazi regime pressure on the Bishop of Mainz to display the swastika flag on his churches on national “patriotic days,” including the recent January 30th anniversary of Hitler’s coming to power in 1933.  Nuncio Orsenigo complained that Mainz, under force of a Nazi regime decree applicable to it alone, was the only Catholic diocese displaying the swastika flag on the designated days.  Mentioning that German Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen was already involved in the issue, Orsenigo emphasized the personnel distress felt by the Mainz Bishop.
   <p>On March 6, 1934, the Rector of Munich’s Cathedral of Our Lady [<em>Frauenkirche</em>] received a letter from a Nazi official expressing his astonishment [<em>Erstaunen</em>] that “the symbol of the new Germany, the swastika,” was not displayed on the Cathedral together with Bavarian flags and Church flags on the most recent flag display day.  The “Flag Question” file of the Archbishop of Munich, Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, includes a copy of a 1929 Prussian state law exempting churches from obligations on flag display days, along with many other documents about the issue.  Whether or not Cardinal Faulhaber personally cited that law to Nazi regime authorities, they certainly got the impression that Catholic Bishops were adopting legalistic defenses rather than showing enthusiasm for the Nazi flag.

<a name="i139"></a><p><u>passage</u> of German Government diplomatic note to Vatican:  “... The Church knows well, from its own experience, the close association that a people has with the symbols of its inner vitality.  That the decision whether to display the symbols of nationalist Germany on church buildings is mostly framed as an issue of rights rather than joyful participation in the fulfillment of a duty seen by the people as a patriotic matter of course, shows a deplorable lack of sympathy, with consequences that are not the fault of the government or the people.”</p><br>

<a name="i40pagenote"></a><p><u>40-page note</u> to German Government from Cardinal Pacelli: The full section of the diplomatic note concerning the display of the swastika reads as follows in English translation.  
 
  <blockquote>The Promemoria maintains that the scruples of the bishops against the hoisting of the swastika flag on the churches should be seen as ‘a deplorable lack of sympathy’ with the new reality of the nation.  Anyone familiar with the many un-Christian or even anti-Christian meanings that often have been and are being given to this symbol by National Socialists, will be able to understand that the bishops’ scruples were and are justified.  To see in this any kind of hostile attitude toward the state is false.  Beginning on the day when the swastika is no longer connected by its partisan champions with meanings and missions whose anti-Christian tendency offends the faithful, the resistance based on religious considerations will diminish of its own accord.  It should also be considered that in other countries where relations between Church and State are amicable – countries with no less claim to be ‘authoritarian’ states – the display of national flags on the churches has never been demanded, as for example in Italy.  Anyone who appreciates the character of the Catholic Church as house of God and abode of the eucharistic presence and the liturgical sacrifice will understand the reasons why the truly religiously sensitive person must wish that this realm, dedicated to the eternal, not be dragged into the din and conflict of the day.  A Catholic way of expressing solidarity with the people on patriotic holidays will never be rejected if the bishops are allowed freedom to find the forms that they consider appropriate.</blockquote>

  <p>The concept of “meaning and mission” of the swastika had been clearly stated by Hitler in  <em>Mein Kampf</em>, as we saw above: the “mission” of the Nazi Party “always was and always will be antisemitic.”  The original 25-point Nazi Party program, announced when Hitler and a small group of organizers launched the National Socialist German Workers Party at the <em>Hofbräuhaus</em> in Munch on February 24, 1920, left no doubt about the Nazi Party’s self-appointed antisemitic mission.  Approximately half of the points of that program were explicitly or implicitly antisemitic, beginning with point no. 4, which provided that only members of the German <em>Volk</em> can be German citizens and, “No Jew can be a member of the German <em>Volk</em>.”  In non-Nazi uses, the German noun <em>Volk</em> means “people.”  As used by the Nazis, <em>Volk</em> has a distinctive, racially inflected meaning.  It included a vaguely described category of Germanic people.  It excluded an amorphous and malleable set of non-Germanic peoples.  The one category that was most emphatically excluded from the Nazi category of <em>Volk</em> was persons of Jewish ethnic heritage, regardless of religious belief or practice, and this was the only category of Germans explicitly placed outside the <em>Volk</em> in the Nazi Party Program.  The 25-point Nazi Program, essentially a political party platform, remained unchanged from 1920 through the end of Nazi Germany.
   <p>Cardinal Pacelli was aware of <em>Mein Kampf</em>; whether he was specifically aware of Hitler’s passage about the meaning and mission of the swastika is not known.  According to the memoirs of his long-time housekeeper, secretary and assistant, Sister Pascalina Lehnert, Pacelli expressed astonishment in 1929 that some Catholics did not recognize the true nature of Hitler in light of <em>Mein Kampf</em>.
