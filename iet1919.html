<blockquote><p>... The Zionists here claim that the Jews are to have the domination of the Holy Land under a British protectorate; in other words, they are going to force their rule on an unwilling people of whom they form only 10%. They are already asserting themselves in every way, claiming official posts for their nominees, and generally interfering.  This has resulted already in a great lessening of the welcome, which, at the outset, was given wholeheartedly to the British... The Zionists too claimed that they had obtained the approval of the Holy City ... There is no foundation for this claim.  The whole movement appears to be quite contrary to Christian sentiment and tradition.  Let Jews live here by all means, if they like, and enjoy the same liberties as other people; but that they should ever again dominate and rule the country would be an outrage to Christianity and its Divine founder...

<blockquote>... These fears of the “Frankfurter Zeitung” are not, in truth, unfounded. The “Peter-Pages” of Trier – well-known organ of the integralists – in its latest issue (no. 14 of 1918/1919) publishes an article entitled “Ein Wort über die Bayerische Volkspartei”: (A word about the Bavarian People’s Party), in which it attacks this party for not being bound, according to the article writer, to full loyalty to the Government <em>by the grace of God</em>, instead supporting popular sovereignty; and for having called non-Catholics and Hebrews to collaborate within its ranks. A similar attack is made also against the Bavarian Catholic press, which, says the writer – is no more Catholic, but Christian, bourgeois and Bavarian. Finally the Catholic Associations are also not spared, which – in what the article states – have been transformed into political associations...</blockquote>

<p><em>Germania</em>, Jan. 31, 1919, page one:

<blockquote>“Bolshevism Advancing”

<p> The Russian Bolsheviks loom not far from the East Prussian border and are close to directly threatening German territory.  The worst for us is the fact that despite the Bolshevistic equality in their army, the iron discipline of the Czarist era has been re-introduced, even to the point of capital punishment and flogging; in this regard the soldiers’ councils have been completely abolished and in their place the so-called Caring Councils have arisen, which generally have not the slightest influence on the command in purely military matters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This Is Bolshevism!”

<p>Subhead:  “A Witness of the Murders in Dorpat” Dateline Libau, Jan. 30

<p> The press officer of the German embassy to Latvia and Estonia declares:  For the idealists and enthusiasts in Germany who still misjudge matters and think they are right to perceive the Bolshevik movement as a spiritual movement, they may be interested in a report that a doctor from Dorpat, Dr. Wolfgang von Reyber, confirmed concerning the latest murderous act that the Bolshevists have committed in the surrendering of Dorpat. 
   
<p>During the morning of January 14th, as Estonian troops were starting to make their way into the city, the Bolsheviks drove 23 hostages into the cellar of the Credit Bank building, where they were killed.  Dr. von Reyber, as a medical doctor, was able to see the still warm corpses toward one o’clock in the afternoon ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Communication Between Dioceses in the Occupied Zone and the Holy See”
<p>The Dioceses in the occupied portion of Germany have been completely cut off from communication with the Holy See.  Until now such communication had been conducted via the Nunciature in Munich, but now it is not possible to send letters to the individual Dioceses or to receive letters from the individual Bishops or their Diocesan officials.  As a result, even very important documents arriving from Rome and being sent to Rome are not being forwarded.

<p>State Secretary Erzberger is trying, therefore, to agree with the Allies on orders that will bring an end to this intolerable situation as soon as possible, so that the Diocesan authorities will be able to communicate unhindered, both by mail and by telegraph with the Nunciature, as was the case in Belgium when it was formerly occupied by Germany...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Headline:“On the Run from the Bolsheviks”

<p> On January 28 the Ukrainian Directorate and Cabinet fled Kiev as the Soviet troops approached.  The seat of government has been moved to Winnitze.  The Ukrainian high command believes it can hold the Dnepr line against the Soviet Bolsheviks.  

<p>Headline:  “Today Still No Advance”

<p>The Spartacists have occupied some villages in the neighborhood of Bremen, situated near Verden.  Two autos sent from Bremen fired on a rider from the Gerstenberg Division.  The Division staff left the representatives of the Bremen occupying forces in no doubt that negotiations would be immediately broken off and military operations would be instantaneously resumed if there was any movement into Bremen from Bremerhaven or Wilhelmshaven or perhaps also from Tuphafen.  The greatest importance was placed upon achieving the goal of expeditious re-establishment of order in Bremen in a calm and peaceful manner.  The citizens of Bremen were therefore allowed time to take the required measures toward disarmament, assurances having been given that no advance toward Bremen would be undertaken today.  Thus, operations will in no event be commenced before tomorrow.

<p>The troops assigned to operations against Bremen . . . Both Brigades come from Berlin, where they took a leading part in the overthrow of the Spartacists.

The first transports entered Verden on the night of the 29th.  

<p>Subhead:“20,000 Armed Men in Bremen”

<p>It is reported that the Bremen Radicals have more than 20,000 armed men at their disposal, though the numbers may be exaggerated.  A report that they have artillery and tanks was denied by government officials.  The main strength of the Spartacists is represented by the units in Gröpelingen.  As Bremen newspapers previously reported, entrenchments were begun there, in order to establish defensive positions in the event that government authorities decided to do battle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Headline:  “Bolshevism and Education”

<p>The destructive impact of Bolshevik domination over the field of Russian cultural life has been described recently by Prof. Dr. J. Rostowzew of the University of Petersburg, member of the Russian Academy of Scholarship, in the January issue of the South German Monthly, appearing under the title “Bolshevism.”  Rostowzew endured almost the entire year of Lenin’s regime.  He writes:  If the Bolsheviks have not yet today succeeded in completely destroying the last traces of civilized life in Russia, it is only because the intellectual powers of the country still continue to be active – despite Bolshevism and in continual struggle with it.

<p>I will begin with Russian scholarship and education. At the summit of Russian scholarship, since the time of Peter the Great, stands the Russian Academy of Scholarship.  It created Russian scholarship and, in association with the Russian universities, secured the respect of the entire academic world for Russian scholarship.  Initially, even the Bolshiviks did not dare to lay a hand on this nerve center of Russian culture, but only initially.  As I was leaving Russia, the fate of the Academy in Bolshevik circles was already decided.  The Academy must be “democratized,” i.e., destroyed.  In the place of the former Institution a new Academy was founded, and indeed with the difference that this new Academy would be founded not by men of scholarship, but rather by a general referendum involving all so-called “Specialties,” i.e., by the representatives of all those who claim to possess any sort of specialized knowledge, no matter what sort of ignoramuses they might actually be.  The shape of the rebuilding by the Bolsheviks was made clear from the outset.  Thus legal scholarship and the entire group of humanities faculties must disappear, as unfruitful and useless branches of scholarship.  Their place must be taken, in the new socialist Academy, by a new group of socialist scholarly fields, as the socialist fanatics, these true theologians of quasi-scholarly socialist religion, have worked out.
	
<p>In a similar way the future of the universities was laid out.  The jurisprudential and philosophical faculties must, by the Bolshevik plan, be eliminated.  The new university must be “democratic” – neither the students nor the professors need any kind of governmental, academic, or other qualification.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“The Israelites Claim: 1st The ‘Restitution’ of Palestine, 2nd ‘Their Own National Existence’ Among All the Other Peoples”

<p>From the <em>Peuple Juif</em> [Jewish People], a “review edited by the Zionist Federation of France,” (Jan. 24, 1919):

<p>... France is the classic country of Jewish emancipation.  It was there that civil equality of Jews was proclaimed for the first time, and the honor has fallen to France of being the country where the work of our liberation, which she commenced, will be fully achieved...

<p>The Jewish people now expect from the Paris Peace Conference not only the rights that will be useful for this or that individual Jew, but also the rights that will be useful for the nation and will strengthen it.  Each Jew, as a Jew, will only be entirely free when free as a people.

<p>The freedom of the Jewish people can only be obtained if one recognizes: that our nation is a nation with the same entitlement as other nations: that it has a right to a national <em>home</em> like all other peoples; that this <em>home</em>, this country, is Palestine, to which Jewish history, traditions and ideas are indissolubly bound.

<p>Whatever rights may be accorded Jews in different countries, if we are not given at the same time our own country, we will lack a solid base to continue our development, a base where we will be able to weave the golden threads of our culture, which has already given so much and can give yet so much more to the world...

<p>The United States of America will surely be on the side of England in these questions.  We hope that France, this France that gave the first great example of this Jewish emancipation, far from opposing, will on the contrary help the other liberal and democratic powers to realize this act of justice toward an eternally martyred people.  Any other supposition is inadmissible and would be too sad...

<p>We expect the Jews of Paris and of all France to rise up to the level of the Jewish masses of all the other countries; to demonstrate their will, like the others, to see Palestine given to the Jews, to put all their influence to work for that.

<p>I can assure that the great, overwhelming majority of the Jewish people are really nationalist and profoundly Zionist.  May the French Jews fraternize in this regard with their brethren!  We hope for this.  It should be.  Because their influence is so great, they are placed so close to the source of all our hopes – the Paris Peace Conference!

<p>Let us all unite, placing all our energies at the service of the great cause – the realization of a Jewish home in Palestine – in order to be able to carry out our own part in the common and ever-complex work of civilization.  From now own may that part be no longer dispersed, anonymous, aprocryphal and unvalued, but Jewish, original, strong, appreciable.

<p>The time is serious.  Our ideal has risen up, our hopes are great.  May each of us do his duty.

<p>Morris Myer, Director of the London daily “The Jewish Times”

<p>The same issue of the <em>Peuple Juif</em> details its thought by this suggestive reflection:

<p><strong>A good example.</strong> It may possibly be to the new State of Czecho-Slovakia that the honor will fall for being the first to recognize for the Jews of its country the right to constitute a national minority and to enjoy national autonomy as a result.  At least, President Masaryk made this promise to the Jewish delegation of Prague, who had come to submit their claims.

<p>I do not propose to say here what exact form this autonomy might take.  It will suffice for me to make the observation that this problem has been dealt with by our friends with all the attention it deserves, in Russia as well as in Poland and Galicia, and that the program as outlined can be immediately put into operation, leaving to the future the necessary revisions.

<p>Independent Lithuania, we hear from the mouth of its Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rosenbaum, has recognized for the Jews of that country the right to their own national existence among the three other nationalities that live there, the Latvians, White Russians and Poles.

<p>In Ukraine, despite innumerable difficulties resulting from the troubled political condition in which the country finds itself, the Jews have been constituted an autonomous nationality, having their Council and their national representation.

<p>What better solution, just and rational at the same time, will the 800,000 Jews of Galicia find, shunted between the Ruthenians and the Poles, than to be constituted, themselves as well, as a Jewish national minority?

<p>What to say of the millions of our brothers who live in Poland?  They must have guarantees against the recurrence of chauvinistic excesses by an excited population.  Organized around their representatives and their institutions, they will be able to put their collective energy to the service of their national interests as well as the service of the new Polish State.

<p>And the 300,000 Jews of Bessarabia and Bukovina?  And the 80,000 Jews of Salonika?

<p>The example will be followed and should be.

<p>That will resolve a great part of our problem.

<p>Comment by <em>Documentation Catholique</em>: Concerning the role of the Israelites in these recent events, and most especially of Bolshevism and of its collusions with Germany, the <em>Univers</em> (Feb. 2, 1919) recounts these lines by Edward Meyer, professor at the University of Berlin:

<p>“We must let the idea sink in that the current war will be followed by another series of wars, until the supreme decision: one must envision the situation that is imposed on us, without recoiling before the consequences it brings.”</blockquote>

<a name="5"></a><p><strong>Feb. 23, 1919</strong> Pacelli’s report to Gasparri about a failed counter-revolution attempt on Feb. 19, the assassination of Kurt Eisner on Feb. 21, and the ensuing political situation in Bavaria:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Following up my respectful enciphered report no. 301 of yesterday, I have the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence concerning the recent tragic events in Munich, to the extent it is possible for me in the current difficult circumstances to verify the innumerable reports that are flowing about and which, after all, I have no way to obtain from direct sources.

<p>Just last Wednesday, the 19th, there was an attempt at a second revolution, about which I have not yet been able to learn with exactitude, nor the precise purpose of it, nor who was really directly involved.  Toward evening that day, several hundred armed sailors occupied the Central Train Station, the Post, the Telegraph and Telephone, and seized also the Landtag building, declaring that they were obliged to guarantee the security of parliamentary activities, which were supposed to begin on Friday.  Later they went as far as to imprison the President of Police.  But when they attempted to occupy the barracks of the General Command as well as that of the Pioneers, then they were prevented by soldiers who, with machineguns and rifles, re-occupied all the rooms that had fallen into the hands of the sailors and liberated the President of Police.  In this way it was possible to organize a service of public security, while the leader of the aforementioned sailors was arrested. The Government published a proclamation stigmatizing what had happened and promising the fullest freedom and security for the activities of the upcoming Landtag.  This attempt at revolution was said to be a maneuver by monarchists and Prince Joachim, son of the ex-German Kaiser, who was in Munich incognito, was searched and accompanied militarily to the frontier, although on the other hand no proof could be found of his complicity in the deplorable event.

<p>Relative calm returned, even though not everyone was tranquil about the possibility that the Landtag could conduct its proper activities without incident.

<p>On the 21st, the day the Parliament was to begin, the streets leading to it were militarily occupied from the earliest hours of the morning.  It appeared that all possible measures would be taken to assure the most absolute protection to the Landtag. The Deputies and those invited to the galleries were put through rigorous security.  Especially crowded was the gallery for the journalists, among whom were many correspondents for foreign newspapers.  The Ministers and Deputies took their positions.  The only one missing was Minister President Kurt Eisner.  Then there appeared in the hall, white as a cadaver, Mr. Feschenbach, the young secretary of Kurt Eisner, and announced in an emotional voice that the Minister President had been assassinated.  An unheard-of clamor then took over the Hall.  Cries of terror were heard everywhere, and only with great effort could the President of the Assembly succeed in quelling the tumult somewhat.  A Deputy, Dr. Sussheim, proposed that the session be adjourned, and all the party leaders agreed with him. In the adjacent rooms and corridors cries of indignation over the attack went back and forth, and there were remonstrances against Interior Minister Auer, the well-known political adversary of Eisner. The exits of the Parliament were hermetically sealed and militarily occupied, and a rigorous search was begun on everyone, to ascertain if there were any weapons.

<p>After about one hour the session was reopened.  Auer immediately took the floor, deploring with emotion and strong expressions the assassination of the Minister President, all the more since Eisner had already decided to submit the resignation of his entire Cabinet to the hands of the Landtag.  Minister Auer’s speech was generally approved and interrupted by gestures of satisfaction.  But while Deputy Süssheim was presenting the motion for adjournment of the Landtag sine die, an individual dressed like a soldier but with a civilian hat rushed into the hall, leaped at Minister Auer, and emptied three revolver shots right into his chest.  The Minister was seen to place his hands on his heart and topple onto a chair.  Then shots were heard throughout the hall and a frightful confusion took over the crowd.  A Center Party Deputy, Osel, one of the more respected members of the party, fell, shot by a bullet; other deputies and spectators were wounded.  Someone approached Auer to see if he was still alive, and since he was still breathing, he was transported to the Clinic, where he is lying even now between life and death.

<p>As has been generally reported, this is how the assassination of Kurt Eisner occurred.  He went alone on foot from the Foreign Ministry to the Landtag, which is nearby, when a young man who looked like a student emptied three revolver shots into his neck; Eisner raised his arms, staggered, fell backwards to the ground, and died immediately.

<p>The killer was a Count Arco-Valley, who was immediately attacked by a soldier and mortally wounded, though there is hope now of saving his life.  Since he is a noble, an officer in the army, and a Catholic, the Socialists have found nothing better for exciting the people against the nobility, the officials, and the clergy. The agitation in the city is extraordinary.  All offices and public buildings are closed.  The Tramways are not running.  Automobiles with soldiers and armed civilians are speeding down the streets. Ringing of church bells was compelled, to convoke the people for a rally held on the Theresienwiese [the Oktoberfest field]; large numbers of airplanes flew noisily over the city at low altitude, dropping from on high thousands of revolutionary manifestos.  Red flags, already fluttering everywhere, are now seen at half mast. All the city newspaper offices have been occupied, and just yesterday a newspaper entitled <em>Newspaper of the Central Council</em> came out, which is replacing the other papers that are compelled by force of arms to cease their work.  The Munich Council of soldiers, workers and farmers met immediately.  A Central Council of the Bavarian Republic has been created, establishing a Committee of public safety and formed from elements that are most passionately for the revolution.  Levin, the Leader of the Spartacists who takes part in the Central Council, is strongly advocating a Ministry Council patterned on Russia.  None of the Ministers are present there, except for the Communication Minister and the Social Affairs Minister.  The Minister for Military Affairs has been arrested.  Timm, the Justice Minister, and Hoffmann, the Education Minister, are missing.  As of now the new Government has not been formed, and the Province is under the command of the Central Council of soldiers. The Council has proclaimed a three-day general strike and has ordered that all the proletariat be armed.  In fact work has been suspended everywhere for the past two days, and today manifestos are being posted with the rules, indicating that the workers can have weapons. Various hotels and private houses have been searched and are being guarded by armed military personnel.  At night machinegun and rifle fire is heard all around, and armed soldiers make rounds of the city.  Various victims have already been denounced.  What could happen next is not predictable.  Days of bloodshed and terror perhaps lie ahead for unfortunate Bavaria; may God spare it such a grave disaster!

<p>Meanwhile a war against the Clergy is also beginning. Access for priests to the Military Hospitals has been strictly forbidden, contrary to the decision of the Soldiers’ Council of the hospitals themselves.  A priest may only provide his services in case of death and only if the patient so requested. Moreover, Mass is denied, and religious counsel is denied. The arrest of the leading personalities of the former Royal Court has also begun.  Taken as hostages so far have been the Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Head of the King’s Civil Cabinet, several members of the Senate, many officials; their safety has been assured, if and so long as there are no further counter-revolutionary attempts.  No one is safe any longer in his own house.  Today the dissolution of the army is being announced, and the creation of a republican security guard force formed primarily from the proletariat.  All of the accomplishments, sacrifices and deeds of the “Bavarian People’s Party” and of the parties of order, to create a Parliament that could give the Province tranquility and peace, have been miserably destroyed by the rash act of the assassination of Eisner.  There is now just one tenuous hope, and it is that the Majority Socialists will not go along with the Independents and the Spartacists.  In that case it would be impossible to create a republic directed by Councils of soldiers, workers and farmers, since they would not have the majority of the people behind them, who at least until now have been for the aforesaid Socialists. But the situation today is still so murky that it is impossible to make any predictions.  Meanwhile the Communist movement is spreading to all of Bavaria; to Nuremberg, to Augsburg where revolutionary activities of exceptional seriousness have occurred (in the latter city some of the demonstrators broke into the Bishop’s palace), and a state of siege has been proclaimed there. (note: I learned today from a reliable source that the Bishop of Augsburg managed to flee, miraculously, and only the Canons were present there).

<blockquote>Most Illustrious and Reverend Signore,

<p>Your Most Illustrious Excellency’s Report No. 12015, of February 8th, reached me in due course, on the subject of the transmission of a Memorial directed by various Jewish persons and societies of Frankfurt on Main to the Bishop of Fulda, for the purpose of obtaining the good offices of the Holy Father; to bring an end to the cruelties that are said to have been committed up to now against the Hebrews in Poland and Galicia.

<p>Already in December last year the Holy See had involved in this matter Monsignor Ratti, Apostolic Visitor in Poland, who thus wrote me from Warsaw, dated this January 15th: 

<p>Concerning the pogroms and excesses against the Jews, about which Your Most Reverend Eminence sent me his venerated encrypted cable, it has however occupied me and I am occupying myself and already have some documents in hand; but nothing up to now is very clear and definitive. In Warsaw, certainly, nothing has happened, I say nothing of any importance and seriousness, the Hebrews there are incredibly numerous (300 thousand!), they are abhorred there, but not molested, much less persecuted.

<p>In Kielce, on the 11th and 12th of November 1918, there were serious riots against the Hebrews, of whom four were mortally laid low, 250 injured or badly beaten up. I have before my eyes the minutes of a session of that city council on the first of December: the Hebrews gave blows to the Christians, the Christians to the Hebrews; I expect further information soon…</blockquote>

<a name="6"></a><p><strong>March 2, 1919</strong> Article in <em>Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung</em>, no. 9, pages 67-68, promoting Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theory and reviewing a new book on the same theme:

<blockquote>“Freemasonry”

<p>The value of a polemic can best be recognized by its reception among its opponents.  If one applies this standard to the new work of the well-known German radical parliamentarian, the author of “World Freemasonry, World Revolution, World Republic” (Dr. Wichtl’s proprietary publishing house, price 10 Crowns), one will come to the conviction that, from the standpoint of German-ness there is no book nearly so valuable as this one.  The uproar among the Freemasons and their adherents over the author’s disclosures and inferences will be enormous!  Never before could a work about Freemasons make them so uncomfortable as this.
  
<p>With amazing thoroughness, Dr. Wichtl reveals the works of Freemasonry, which in every country is led by Jews or utilized by them for their own purposes; he sets forth their pernicious purposes and shows the interrelationships between the Lodges and each major political event. Based on a far-reaching mastery of Freemasonic writings, he brings forth proof that nearly every political upheaval occurring in the past 200 years in Europe has had its origin and leadership in the Freemasonic associations, that not only were the revolution in Portugal and the assassination of the Austrian heir in Sarajevo, which was directly instigated by the newly founded (and promoted from Budapest and Paris) Serbian Lodge, the result of Masonic activity, but also the revolutions in Germany and in Austria.  The purposes of Freemasonry are not, as often assumed, the fostering of religious and humanitarian concepts, but rather the destruction of authority and the building up of its own power.  To have brought forward this evidence is one of the main services of the foregoing work.
  
<p>The chapter about Freemasonry in Austria is worthy of the most special attention.  Here is identified not only the political activity of Freemasonry in the time of Maria Theresa, but also – what will arouse especial interest – the participation of Jewry in the Lodges and their leadership.  In this connection the book’s enumeration of the masters of the Vienna Lodges is extraordinarily informative.  We find there a Dr. Holländer, Dr. Engel, Dr. Frankl, Dr. Ornstein, a Dr. Heller, Dr. Schick, A. Kirsch, B. Schiller and the like, not to overlook the “Freemason Prince,” Dr. Krapalik.
  
<p>Also the statements about Freemasonry in Germany deserve to be specially noted.  In this part Wichtl shows how well the head directors of the Masons understand to deceive the great masses of their lower-order brethren and leave them unclear about their true purposes, by the use of slogans and false principles, so that even those who think they are in influential positions are actually nothing but instruments of the “Princes” who stand above them.  In this connection it should not go unmentioned that the highest “Prince” of Freemasonry in the period immediately before the outbreak of the War was none less than a Herr Kohn in Frankfurt am Main, a fact that was carefully hushed up in all the yearbooks of German Freemasonry, undoubtedly for weighty reasons, while all the other leading Freemasons are listed by name.
  
<p>No less interesting than the statements about the participation of Freemasons in great political matters is what is brought into the light about the role of Jewry in Freemasonry.  Even without being an opponent of the Jews, one must come to the conviction on the basis of the foregoing material, just as a significant Christian Freemason once expressed in these words:  “The Freemason is nothing but an artificial Jew.”  If one considers, as Dr. Wichtl likewise points out, that all Masonic brothers are obligated to promote each other wherever they can and to stand by each other in all dangers, yes, and to alert them to any threatening dangers, then one can assess what incomparable support Jewry possesses in Freemasonry, in which it is so numerously represented.</blockquote>

<blockquote>... (p. vi) I had not previously concerned myself seriously with Freemasonry; the Leo Taxil hoax was just a dim memory to me, the names of the infamous Miss Diana Vaughan, her sister Sophie Walder, the devils Bitru and many others came to life in front of me: reason enough to approach the matter with skepticism.  But the evidence was so clear that I took it upon myself to track the matter to ground.  Then it came to pass shortly thereafter, in November 1917, that a very well informed and reliable source shared with me that Dr. Karl Kramarsch was a Freemason and belonged to the “Grand Orient of France.”  So I began to acquaint myself with the literature of Freemasonry, at first for no other reason than to gain clarity for myself on the important issue: a Light Seeker diligently striving to get at the truth.
  
<p>... (p. vii) Even before the appearance of my book, a storm of disapproval went out from the realm of the Freemasonic press.  The “Building Stone,” the monthly journal of the National Supreme Lodge of Hamburg in Berlin, was prepared to defame me even before a single line of my book had come into view!  A “hatchet job” they called it, and again a “hatchet job” and yet again a “hatchet job.”  That was printed in the “Building Stone,” issues 1-2, January-February 1919; my book appeared for the first time on the 8th of March that year.  This senseless uproar caused my publisher to make a simple announcement; it was called especially “provocative” that there was a heading in the table of contents for the 8th chapter, entitled “The Role of the Jews in Freemasonry.”  In issues 6-7 the “Building Stone” turned once again to my book.  They called it a “slanderous writing,” a “pamphlet.”  Most embarrassing to them was my disclosure that at the summit of German Freemasonry, at the time of the outbreak of the World War, stood Supreme Master Kohn...

<p>That the man who stood at the summit of the entire German Freemasonry was named Kohn, they could not dispute.  But that this Herr Kohn should be a Jew, that made them nervous, and they considered it an insult to all of them.  And so the effort had to be made to turn this alleged Jew Kohn into a zealous Christian...

<p>A terrible hailstorm broke out on me in Vienna.  The hailstones were so big that I almost wanted to take shelter under the mysterious carpet of some Lodge or other, (p. ix) until the storm had passed over.  But since I am a Christian and do not consider allowing my person to be separated from my convictions, I certainly did not let myself be found as a Light Seeker in any Vienna Lodge.  For in the Vienna Lodges there are – according to the well-known testimony of the deceased State Court President Holzinger – a hundred two Jews among every hundred Freemasons.  But that is not possible!  That is surely an exaggeration?!  Not at all; here is the evidence: The Supreme Master Dr. Richard Schlesinger is – a Jew; the deputy Supreme Master Dr. Karl Ornstein is – a Jew; the deputy Supreme Master Dr. Adolf Kapralik is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Dr. Emil Frankl is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Dr. Gustav Spieler is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Edward Zinner is – a Jew; the Supreme Registrar Heinrich Glücksmann is – a Jew.  Is that enough, or is more “proof” desired? 

<p>... (p. xii) The forger Margiotta who worked in association with Leo Taxil (whose work I possess also in the French original, but which I refrained from using as an impure source, whereas Margiotta doubtless said the truth)... Jewish Italian Supreme Master Adriano Lemmi ...

<p>(p. 1) Introduction and Overview
In the trial of the assassins of the royal couple who were next-in-line to the Austrian throne, it was convincingly shown that not only did the assassination plan have its origin in the French Supreme Freemason Lodge in Paris, but that some of the assassins were themselves Freemasons.

<p>... Gives secret details of Masonic rites and practices, different types of Lodges, details of the various degrees of Masons ...

<p>(p.49) The Italian brothers appear to give much effort, in fact, to honor Satan as their supreme Lord and Master: Salute, o Satana, O ribellione! ...

<p>(p. 50) Freemasonry and Judaism

<p>An expert on Freemasonry speaks of it concisely and to the point:  Its origin lies in England, the building of its higher degrees followed in France, its intellectual formation in Germany, the externals, however, stem from Judaism.
<p>That is correct, but concerning the last point, incomplete.
Spiritual Masonry is known to be associated with Solomon’s building of the temple, and this wise king plays a large role in Freemasonry...  

<p>(p. 52)  The six-pointed star is supposed to be for Free Masons “an image of the activity of the Word of God, the free essence of divine power!”  This flaming star is always found over the door on the east side of the Lodge hall.  
<p>With this, however, we set forth just a few relationships between Free Masonry and Judaism; in fact there are an enormous number.  Solomon’s throne, for example, appears in Anderson’s constitution book as the seat of the Supreme Master, Solomon’s seal plays an equally great role in the Lodges as Solomon’s signet ring... 

<p>(p. 53) Even though Free Masonry has so little to do with Christianity, it is very much influenced by the Bible and belief in the Bible... There are Lodges in which the vows are no longer taken on the Bible; for the “Supreme State Lodges of Germany,” by contrast, the Bible is not only an image, but a sort of rulebook.   (Remarkably ...)

<p>According to all this one could almost come to the conclusion that Freemasonry was founded by the Jews.  This view, however, is not historically sustainable.  The founders of this association were on the whole Christians who, in the English manner, had a special predilection for the Old Testament.  One of them was the well known English preacher Dr. Jacob Anderson, who published the well known “constitution book of Free and Accepted Masons; ...

<p>(p. 54) but also the names of others have gone into the afterworld, and a Jew is not found among them.  And nevertheless a bridge here leads over to Judaism: The English Jewish antiquary Elias Ashmole, who occupied himself much with secret arts, was taken into the Work of Masonry at the time in the year 1646 and gathered a lot of documents about Freemasonry, which then were used in the erection of the Supreme Lodge of England in the year 1717.  

<p>Chapter VIII.  The Role of the Jews in Freemasonry
 
<p> Hardly had Free Masonry been founded than the Jews tried to gain a strong foothold in it.  That was, to be sure, not so easy; at first indeed the Jews had been denied entry to the Lodges.  For the first time around the year 1780, in Frankfurt am Main, there arose two Jewish Lodges, unbeknownst to the other Lodges...

<p>In Hungary there ensued the refounding of Lodges at the end of the ‘60s in the 19th century; already by the middle of the 1870s the Jewish Freemasons held the leadership . . .

<p>No Lodges without Jews!  This slogan of the Freemasonic journal “Acacia,” concerning the rule in the French Lodges, applied with triple strength in the Hungarian Lodges. . . .

<p>... (p. 57) It is similar in Germany with the Berlin Lodges that come under the Hamburg Supreme Lodge; the Lodge “Victoria” in Berlin has, for example,  Masters Schey ... Rosenberg ... Marcuse ...

<p>But not only in Germany, in Hungary, and in Austria, no, throughout the whole world the Jews are the most energetic and active Freemasons and know how to breathe their spirit into the Lodges and turn them to their own ends...

<p>Let us turn a quick glance toward Italy and perceive that its famous Freemason, Ernesto Nathan, has come into full view.  Who is Ernesto Nathan? ... 

<p>... (p.60) In short: What is influential in Italy is Freemasons, among whom the Jews play a prominent role.  “This race has numerous representatives in the Italian parliament” – says the French Freemason newspaper “Revue Maçonnique” [“Masonic Review”] (January 1908 no. 334 p. 1).  “Far better than anywhere else, the Hebrew spirit has attained its goal in Italy.” (Ibid. page 3.) 

<p>This observation about the “Hebrew spirit” in Italy may well be right, but in other places as well it is exactly the same.  In France, for example, we encounter Jews repeatedly as founders and diligent representatives of Freemason orders.  Among these, for example, is the Parisian Jew Etienne Morin; he was the major disseminator of the “Scottish (highest degree) System” that actually had virtually nothing to do with Scotland... How thoroughly this high degree system is dependent on Biblical history and saturated with the Jewish spirit, is seen upon a fleeting glance at the titles provided for the degrees: there we find the vindictive grade of Knight Kadosch (30th degree), then a Prince of Lebanon, a Prince of the Tabernacle, and even a High Prince of Jerusalem!
   
<p>And now?  The native ranks of nobility are done away with, the princes cast aside, the Kaiser dethroned ... But it will not take long until their seats are occupied once again.  The Kaisers are dead, long live the “Kaisers of the East and the West!”  Pave the way for all who are qualified: for Haase, Eisner, Liebknecht, Adler, Kohn!  Pave the way for Bela Kun!  Friedländer! Bettelheim! Toller! Levien! Leviné!  Pave the way for all these who “live it up” among us, enrich themselves and want to enslave us! ...

<p>The whole similar rite of Memphis owes its origin to a certain Samuel Honis from Cairo ...

<p>But – one could object – there are self-styled foundations of orders which have no right to be considered Freemasonry.  The “German Supreme Lodge” has never recognized them, thus they have no right to recognition.  Granted!  Only the “Grand Orient of France” has recognized them and that (p. 62) suffices completely, even if from the German perspective these orders are seen as false foundations for the purpose of bleeding us via Light Seekers and gullible people.  Moreover, this is not about the issue of whether they are recognized or not, but merely about the evidence that Jews play a role of calling the tune in Freemasonry everywhere, in France as well as Italy, in Hungary as much as in Austria, and especially so in Germany.  Or do you want to deny that the Jew Cremieux, one of the heads of the Scottish Rite, played a key leading role in France?  Was he not part of the February Revolution (1848) alongside other Freemasons of the provisional government?  Or the one-eyed Jew Gambetta?  Do you want to dispute that the high ranking Freemason Gambetta was the one who, in 1869, inveigled the separation of Church and State into the influential Platform of Belleville?  After all, can you deny that one of the political goals of World Masonry is to accomplish the separation of Church and State everywhere?  And that this, where it has already occurred, is chiefly a work of Freemasonry?  And within Freemasonry, particularly a work of the Jews?

<p>Let us see yet again how it is in England.

<p>England, including Scotland, counts 225,000 Freemasons.  Among them are 43,000 Jews, that is nearly a fifth part; yet there are Lodges that are almost exclusively composed of Jews, as for example the Shelley Lodge, which comprises three-fourths Jews, and even purely Jewish Lodges, like the “Hiram Lodge”; the latter indeed gave rise to so many scandals that the Supreme Master of the order, Prince Edward Albert, later Edward VII, had to decide to dissolve it.  Especially significant are the following Lodge names: King Solomon, King David, King Saul, Baron Hirsch, Lord Rothschild, Henry Bernstein, Sir Albert Sassoon, and others... Especially since the Franco-Prussian War, the Jews have victoriously swarmed into the Lodges, while even here the Christian brothers have preferred to surrender the field to the Jews without a fight. . . .

<p> (p. 64)  From these developments, which could be expanded upon with countless further examples, suffice it to say that the Jews are represented within Freemasonry in a strength far exceeding their numbers; hence it follows that the Jewish Freemasons are everywhere the most active and persistent workers and understand how to bring their influence to bear; and it also follows that they strive for the leadership within Freemasonry in all countries, indeed in many states (p.65) they have already seized it for themselves and in their way, that is, striving to use that leadership primarily for the advantage of their race; finally it follows that it is especially Jews who initiate the policy of the Lodges and influence the other brothers toward the same ways.  

<p>If this is really the way matters are today, then the issue is clearly presented, why does almost no one in the entire German Reich see through their game, revolt against it, and stand up to tyrannical Judaism?...

<p> (p.163) ... Communists and Freemasons got along rather well.  The communist Soviet regime, for example, took over the collection begun by the Freemasons for the purpose of erecting a memorial to the Freemason poet Br. Andreas Ady; the Freemason daily newspaper “Vilag” became the organ of the communist People’s Commissariat for Education, and so forth.  That the house of the Hungarian Supreme Lodge was requisitioned and occupied by the guild of the – housekeepers (!) – was less congenial, to be sure, but nevertheless this deed was reported by the “Vienna Freemason Newspaper” without the slightest word of reproach; a sign that they had reconciled ...

<p>Chapter XXIV  Via World Revolution to the Freemasonic World Republic

<p>In a full dozen countries the revolutionary activity of Freemasonry has by now been established.  The spirit is, at its root, always the same, and the end goal is always a republic...

<p> (p. 195) But let us return to the characteristic concepts of this sect.  To free people from the domination of the “Powers” was also the goal of the Illuminati Order, which played a great role in the second half of the 18th century and has many points in common with Freemasonry.  Even then the concept of a World Brotherhood and World Republic exercised its charm, and powerful thinkers such as Immanuel Kant spoke up for it.  In the broader ranks of the German people, however, the republican ideal of government first appeared in the 19th century.  It was represented particularly by the revolutionary and Freemason, Mazzini, whose secret confidantes were hard at work throughout Europe.  For Mazzini, the republic was “the only conceivable just form of government; the people are everything.”  But the “people” are only “everything” if they agree with Mazzini’s point of view and take up the words of this lord and master; if they do not, then they are only an “ignorant and corrupt mob” ... 

<p>Chapter XXV  Freemasonry and World War
  
<p>This issue goes far beyond the title of this book and thus could be left aside; the reader who has followed line for line up to now must surely have come to the unavoidable conclusion: If Freemasonry is really striving toward a World Republic – and about that there is no doubt – if they instigate revolutions everywhere toward this end, and about that there is really no doubt, then they are certainly not guiltless of the horrible, enormous revolution that has occurred, namely the World War itself... (p. 237) 

<p>Chapter XXVI  The Freemasonic Peace Program of Wilson

<p>That the Freemasons bear a large share of the guilt for the outbreak of the World War ...

<p>It is nevertheless still said that the Freemasons apparently had nothing to do with the World War and its frightful armaments and destruction, but rather with a World Revolution, which their ideals brought about, especially the downfall of the European dynasties and the introduction of a World Republic.  If this line of thought is correct, then it will be confirmed by the end result.  And so must, also, the Wilson Peace Program, which represents the high point of the historical developments brought about by the War, correspond with the chief demands of the goals of Freemasonry, and all the more so, since Wilson himself is a Freemason.  

<p>Conclusion 

<p> (p. 257) ... This book had to be written, it was a moral necessity.  And it had to come from a politician known to Germans, not from quarters that could be suspected as “clerical” or “ultramontane” or “Jesuitical.”  The “clericals” have truly done enough in this field to enlighten the people; if they were not believed, that is for the most part our own fault.

<p>One more word now about the republic.  From my writings, any impartial reader would be led to the conclusion that I am not much inclined to the republican form of government.  My standpoint is really this:

<p>A good German-Austrian republic led by ethnic Germans, in which everyone is filled with good will for the common good, is a hundred times preferable to me over a bad monarchy.

<p>A good monarchy, on the other hand, with a capable, well-advised, smart, hardworking, virtuous, reliable German Kaiser at the head, is a thousand times preferable to me over an arbitrary lawyer-run republic under a “Mason Prince” of the likes of an Eisner, Lenin, Adler or Kohn.</blockquote>

<p>Deny it if you will and can:  The most fateful problem of our time is the question of the separation of Church and State.  The old and ever new conflict between Christianity and materialism, between faith and unbelief, will be ever more concentrated in the future upon the platform plank: for or against “separation.”
  
<p>No Christian nation where State and Church have worked up to now hand in hand will avoid this frightful struggle.  No one should give in to deception in this regard.  Just as the subversive idea of the great French Revolution of 1789 flew right through every civilized country and brought the 18th century under the yoke of liberalism, from which the nations have been freeing themselves only slowly and through the most bitter struggles, so the idea of separation is hurrying through all states that have been bound to the Christian Church by faith and history, bringing them violent crises and fateful struggles.  Not without reason is it maintained that the transition to a republican form of government in recent history is so self-evidently bound up with separation of Church and State that it is directly considered the formal obligation of every new republican state to immediately implement this separation...

Who can ever tell the full story of all the efforts of Our predecessors to free them from the dominion of infidels, the heroic deeds and the blood shed by the Christians of the West through the centuries? And now that, amid the rejoicing of all good men, they have finally returned into the hands of the Christians, Our anxiety is most keen as to the decisions which the Peace Congress at Paris is soon to take concerning them. For surely it would be a terrible grief for Us and for all the Christian faithful if infidels were placed in a privileged and prominent position; much more if those most holy sanctuaries of the Christian religion were given into the charge of non-Christians.

<p>We learn, too, that non-Catholic foreigners, furnished with abundant means and profiting by the great misery and ruin that the war has brought on Palestine, are there spreading their errors. Truly harrowing indeed is the thought that souls should be losing their faith and hastening to damnation on that very spot where Jesus Christ Our Lord gained for them life eternal at the cost of His Blood. Helpless, deprived of all they have, those poor souls are stretching out to us suppliant arms imploring not only food and clothing but the rebuilding of their churches, the re-opening of their schools, the restoration of their missions. To this end We have for Our part already set aside a certain sum, and most willingly would We give more if the present poverty of the Holy See allowed.  But it is our intention to excite the interests of the Bishops of the whole Catholic world that they may take to heart such a noble and holy cause, arousing among all the faithful that sense of active charity which their ancestors always showed towards their brethren of the Orient.

<blockquote>“What Is Bolshevism?”

<p>At the end of November 1918, I was fleeing Russia and traveling from Frankfurt on the Oder to Berlin in a jam-packed rail car with soldiers and some Berlin laborers who had just come from the province of Posen and had hoarded potatoes, as they told me, at the rate of 75 Pfennigs a pound. Impressed by the terrors I had experienced at the hands of the Red Guards during the previous ten days, they were soon talking with me about Bolshevism. It was really peculiar that not one of the people in my compartment knew anything about the Bolsheviks, even though all of them had participated in the Berlin Revolution and were avid newspaper readers, from what they said. I had to be the one to tell them what the Bolsheviks really are and what they want.

<p>It still happens to me often, both close to home and in foreign places, that I am asked what the Bolsheviks really are, or I encounter totally false views about Bolshevism. For many people, the Bolsheviks are just a bugaboo to use to scare Progressives, or to scare people away from joining revolutionary parties, just as I once heard a lady in Poland say to her ill-mannered child: be good, or else the Bolsheviks will come and take you away.  Bolshevism is not so dangerous, according to these people.  Others, on the other hand, see in Bolshevism the embodiment of all evil, as when a Russian Count told me: I never used to believe that mankind descended from the apes.  But since I saw how the Bolsheviks murdered my son, I believe that man is really a beast. Or when I was once invited to an estate for a luncheon, and in the course of the meal there arose talk about the Bolsheviks, and the lady next to me gave a shriek and fainted. The word Bolshevik worked on her like a knock-out drug. For the Bolsheviks had condemned her husband and her four children.  Even the following has actually been encountered: In Berlin at the end of November a couple gentlemen of well-bred class, who said they were good Catholics who fulfill their religious duties, wanted to show me that Bolshevism not only has religious merit, but is actually the religion of the future, the fulfillment of the teaching of the divine Savior.

<p>What, in reality, is Bolshevism?

<p>The word <em>Bolsheviki</em> comes from the Russian word <em>bolshoi</em>, which means “more.”  Thus it could be thought that the Bolshevik Party is what we call in Germany the “Majority Socialists.”  But that is not correct; the opposite is the case.  In Russia the Bolsheviks are the extreme, radical wing of the former Russian Socialist Party.  The Bolsheviks did not first receive their name in the recent Revolution.  That has existed, rather, since the year 1903.  That was when the Russian Socialist Party split apart in two directions: the Bolsheviks or maximalists; those were the extremists; and the Mensheviks (the word comes from “mensché” or “less”) or the minimalists, the moderates.  The maximalists or Bolsheviks are the most determined Socialists.  They want to take the ideals and goals of Social Democracy, as set forth by Marx, the father of Social Democracy, in his Communist Manifesto of 1848, and implement them at all cost down to the smallest detail.  They know nothing of holding back and nothing of being humane.  What they want must be implemented by power and terror.  They have no desire to negotiate with any parties.  Because, they say, the people will be cheated in all negotiations and the capitalists will get off scot-free.  The Bourgeoisie must be completely annihilated by any means. That is why they wanted, from the beginning, the arming of the Proletariat and the disarming of all property owners.  In contrast to them, the Mensheviks represented the moderate standpoint.  They also wanted the goals of Social Democracy from the outset, but not by power, rather by peaceful, calm development in cooperation with the other Socialist parties and with the Bourgeoisie.  They desired that all elements of the population should work together for the upbuilding of civilization and the elevation of the poorest classes of the people.  Thus the Bolsheviks or maximalists correspond to our Spartacus League with Rosa Luxemburg and Liebknecht, and perhaps still with our Independent Socialist Party with Haase and Ledebour and Eisner. Their opponents, the Mensheviks or minimalists, would then correspond to our Majority Social Democrats with Ebert and Scheidemann and Auer.

<p>There were, at the time in Russia, however, a full dozen Socialist parties, which almost all stood in contrast to the Bolsheviks.  At the moment the Bolsheviks officially call themselves: the Russian Communist Party.

<p>The leader of the Russian Bolsheviks and the current lord of Russia is Lenin, Vladimir Ulyanov Lenin, a lawyer from Simbirsk on the Volga. As a result of his Bolshevik agitating, he had to flee at one time, and he returned from Switzerland to Russia after the fall of the Russian Czar.  In Switzerland he had lived at the expense of the former German Government, and for his return journey to Russia, the German Embassy gave him a passport and a false name, and placed a rail car at his disposal, which traveled as a neutral entity right through Germany to Russia with Lenin and Trotsky.

<p>One cannot outline the character of Lenin better than what the well-known Russian Socialist writer Maxim Gorky did in his newspaper <em>Novaya Zhizn</em>, in the issue of November 10, 1917, which was three days after the Bolshevik Revolution: “Vladimir Lenin is ushering in the Socialist storm on the government in Russia according to Netschajew’s recipe: Full steam ahead!” Lenin himself is by nature a man of exceptional power; for twenty-five years he stood in the ranks of the fighters for the final triumph of Socialism.  He is one of the most significant and most original phenomena within the international Social Democratic movement.  He is a highly gifted man, with all the attributes necessary for a leader.  At the same time he is signally lacking in morals, necessary for this role, and a self-disciplined, merciless relationship to the life of the popular masses.

<p>He works with the well-being and life of the people like a chemist in a laboratory.  But while the chemist uses lifeless material and thereby attains results that have value for life, Lenin operates with living material and brings ruin to the people and the revolution.

<p>The Holy Father held a secret Consistory with 22 Cardinals taking part. In his Allocution, the Holy Father expressed what a lively interest the Roman Church takes in the Eastern Churches.  The Pope recalled, among other things, the recently successful creation of a union for the Eastern Churches and the foundation of an Italian-Albanian seminary at Grottaferrata, and he pointed out that during the war he made crystal clear his special concern for Armenia, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon and gave a helping hand to the peoples there. In relation to the future form of the Ottoman Empire, the Pope expressed the desire that the Peace Conference might deliver the Holy Places into the hands of the Christians. It would be extremely painful for the Holy See if a predominant position in Palestine were conceded to unbelievers, or if the Holy Places were to come into the hands of non-Christians.

<p>The Holy Father received the Ambassador of the Hungarian Republic in an audience, Dr. Oskar Charmann, who also temporarily represented the Hungarian Republic in Vienna.  The Hungarian Republic is working to establish contact directly with the Vatican concerning the resolution of various issues.- The “International League of Nations Conference” meeting in Bern, at which 24 nations are represented via peace associations and league of nations organizations, brought up a resolution whereby the involvement of the Holy Father in the league of nations would be provided for.

<blockquote>Re: Political Situation

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The domestic political situation in Germany, and particularly in Bavaria, is becoming ever more grim and threatening.  The Majority Socialists are losing more ground every day, while their former followers are swelling the ranks of the Independents and the Spartacists. For this reason it is thought that the Bavarian Minister-Presidency of the Socialist Hoffman will not be able to survive long. Above all, the Spartacists are conducting an extremely extensive and active propaganda campaign. In crowded assemblies right in the public streets, Communist orators are preaching the new word with fervid, captivating language and are winning over very large numbers of followers. Thus the thought is spread in the minds of all that new and terrible upheavals are being prepared, which will lead to the triumph of Bolshevism.  On the other hand, if I am to believe a report that came to me quite recently from Minister Erzberger, it is thought in Berlin that the Russian Government may be considering an invasion of Germany through southern Latvia, simultaneously with a domestic uprising of the German Bolsheviks to cooperate thereby in the Soviet victory.

<p>The progress of the extreme parties is fed and favored by a sense of desperation into which the population has fallen because of the prospect of adamant peace conditions that will be imposed, it is said, by the Entente.  A distinguished and habitually moderate German diplomat expressed openly to me yesterday that in the event that the imposed conditions are intolerable and reduce Germany to slavery, he himself would prefer Bolshevism.  Then Germany, united to Russia, and with the support of Hungary, would become invincible.  Russia has inexhausible natural resources, and Germany has the culture and technology to use them.  France and Italy would be running a formidable risk, all the more since their armies, which indeed fought valiantly against the former autocratic states, would be difficult to deploy now against their proletarian brethren in Russia and Germany.  May God inspire the men of State meeting now in the Paris Peace Conference with sentiments of moderation and thus spare Europe from a new scourge more horrible than the past war!

At first this might appear not really so regrettable - it should be, as it appears, only the removal of a compulsion; but whoever knows the intentions of the State Government and also understands something of the technique of the school policy, will recognize clearly that this decree is the beginning of forcing religious instruction out of the schools...

<blockquote>Re: Presentation rights for parishes and benefices in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>By Report No. 11066 of November 28, 1918, Monsignor Auditor of this Nunciature, in my temporary absence, sent Your Most Reverend Eminence a petition addressed to the Holy Father by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, also in the name of the other Bishops of Bavaria, concerning the presentation rights of the current Government for the parishes and the benefices (non-consistorial). In this petition the aforesaid Bishops, “to prevent ruin and greater evils,” asked “that the Apostolic See use indults (presentation rights) still valid also for the present government to tolerate its worthiness in such a way  that we Bishops would designate three suitable names from which the present government would choose one, on the condition that payments to benefices and churches would be made in the future and this would be only for the time being.”

<p>Your Eminence, in Encrypted Cable No. 169 of December 27, deigned to instruct Monsignor Schioppa to communicate to the Bavarian Bishops that “the Holy See is disposed to examine the needs of the new situation if a new Government in Bavaria is durably constituted and is willing to negotiate with it. In the meantime Bishops, in individual cases, can act on their own, in a way solely de facto, without prejudicing Canon Law principles and without compromising the Holy See, possibly by setting up temporary parish administrators.”
<p>Monsignor Auditor conveyed the above-referenced response without delay to Archbishop Faulhaber and via him to the other Bavarian Prelates. 
<p>The difficult abnormal political conditions in Bavaria being prolonged, however, the issue has inevitably suffered new complications both in terms of law and by way of events.

<p>In terms of law, the Bishops, while being unanimous in their intention not to cause any prejudice to canonical principles and to the rights of the Holy See, do not agree rather in the concrete issue, whether or not the presentation by the current Government can be allowed for the aforesaid parishes and benefices, and thus whether it is licit for the Bishops to propose the required list of three names to the competent Ministry. So, in fact, the Archbishop of Munich is inclined to maintain the necessity for an indult from the Holy See, while the Archbishop of Bamberg (as seen in his letter to Abp. Faulhaber dated March 20, 1919, which he shared with me) maintains that so long as the Concordat remains in effect, the Bishops can allow the presentation under discussion and he also proposes the formula to be adopted in the future for the three-name list. The excellent Archbishop von Hauck supports his opinion by a memorandum by Monsignor Hollweck, a copy of which I have the honor to send here-enclosed to Your Eminence. This learned canon lawyer begins by observing that Concordats are always concluded between the Holy See, as the supreme and universal representative of the ecclesiastical power, and the Government of the State, whatever may be the organ that has the power and represents it, whether it is that of a Monarch, or an oligarchy or a parliament that exercises its rights by means of a specified plenipotentiary, the Government of the State presents itself in every territory as a power subsisting in fact and immutable, derived from the existence of the State itself and in which the State itself exists in a concrete form; which, then, however at the moment this power is manifested and how it is exercised, is a matter irrelevant in itself. Therefore, continues Monsignor Hollweck, the Concordats remain undoubtedly in effect, since the State, with which they are concluded, exists at least substantially with its territory, however the State itself may have changed, and he cites the words of the Most Eminent Cardinal Cavagnis (Institu. Juris publ. eccles., I, 694): “… [extended Latin quotation]” Thus (adds Monsignor Hollweck) the Concordat concluded with Napoleon I continued in effect under the Bourbons, then under the Duke of Orléans, thus under the Republic, and then under Napoleon III, and finally again under the Republic until 1905. The Holy See upholds as a firm principle that changes in the form of the Government do not affect the validity and duration of the Concordat. Only the provision (according still to Monsignor Hollweck) concerning the appointment of Bishops, which in a totally exceptional way constitutes a personal privilege conceded to the King of Bavaria and only so long as he is Catholic, has ceased with the fall of the Monarchy, having lost the subject of the privilege itself. As a result of this, concludes the aforesaid canon lawyer, the Government’s right of presentation for the so-called royal parishes must be recognized without hesitation, even with regard to the current holders in fact of power in the State, and it is also up to them to decide how and by what official of the Government they want to exercise that right, it being a matter of total indifference whether it is done by the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs. It is also unimportant what religion the State official in question belongs to, since it comes into question here only insignificantly. It would certainly be convenient if it was only done by Catholics, but membership in the Jewish religion for such an official of the Bavarian Government, per se, would only be an incidental defect. As it appears to Monsignor Hollweck, therefore, the practice in effect up to now can be maintained. If however the Concordat were subsequently directly or indirectly repudiated by a separation of Church and State, then common law would automatically come into effect, with the royal patronato having disappeared, there would be the right of free appointment by the Bishops under the norms of Canon 1432 § 1.

<p>There is no doubt that the Bavarian Concordat (still according to the above-referenced teaching of the Most Eminent Cavagnis) <u>in its entirety</u> remains in effect even after the recent change in the form of the Government; but it appears that it would be licit to question whether the <u>exception</u> admitted expressly by Monsignor Hollweck for the right to appoint to vacant Bishop seats might be valid also for the presentation right to the parishes and non-consistorial benefices. In fact, privileges that run <u>against Canon Law</u> must be strictly construed, and therefore are to be considered rather as personal privileges than as privileges in re; this rule obviously applies above all to the right of appointment or presentation, which is odious, because it diminishes the liberty of the Church in conferring benefices (Canons 50, 68, 1471, De Luca, <em>De Jurepatron</em>, disc. II nn. 3-5, 12-13).   Moreover the Republic arising upon the collapse of the Monarchy could not present to the Holy See those guarantees in view of which the indult of presentation was accorded to the King of Bavaria.  And that is why the Most Eminent Cardinal Cavagnis teaches (I. c., II, nn. 129 et seq.): “…[extended Latin quotation].” Nor would it be, in itself, sufficient reason to lay claim to the Bavarian Government’s continuing up to now to pay to the parishes and to the other benefices the customary subsidy, since that is owed as a partial restitution of the goods usurped already from the Church. But it seems that, although the right of presentation should not pass automatically to the new Government, but should be requested as a new pontifical concession , this must not necessarily be explicit, however, it being sufficient for this purpose that it be an implicit or tacit recognition by the Holy See. Greater difficulties have arisen in the course of events.

<p>In the first place, the Bishops are not in agreement about their conduct. It does not seem clear to them, truly, if the above-referenced response of the Holy See would or would not mean a <u>tolerari potest</u>; many, including the Archbishop of Munich, are not eager to present a list of three candidates, for fear that this would mean prejudicing Canon Law principles and the rights of the Holy See itself, and they have sought up to now to make do by means of parish administrators; others, instead, have either made such presentations already, such as (according to what Abp. Faulhaber has reported) the Bishop of Speyer, or are inclined to do so, especially after Monsignor Hollweck’s memorandum, like the Archbishop of Bamberg. This diversity of conduct, already harmful in itself, especially under current circumstances, creates toward the Prelates of the first category serious discontent from the Government as well as the clergy. In fact, discontent toward the Bishops is growing especially among the clergy, since not a few priests, failing to take account of the circumstances, are attributing to the respective Bishops the delay in appointments of parish pastors; and this discontent, of which there has even been some echo in the Socialist press, is all the more grave, in that the Government subsidy for parish administrators is much less than that for parish pastors, and thus very often, because of the continuing price inflation, insufficient to live on. Finally, it cannot be denied that the simple parish administrators do not enjoy the same authority as parish pastors, either in the view of the public authorities or in the view of the faithful, and that authority is so essential in these turbulent times.  For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is not surprising if many Bishops desire that the Holy See would benevolently tolerate the exercise of the right of presentation by the current Republican Government, or at least, in order to achieve uniformity in the conduct of the Bishops, would deign to declare in more explicit language its mind in this regard, naturally only for the knowledge and guidance of the Bishops themselves, and without them bringing into the discussion or compromising in any way the Holy See vis-à-vis the Government.

<p>In the often-mentioned response to Monsignor Auditor of this Nunciature, the Holy See says it is disposed to examine the needs of the new situation, once a Government, durably constituted, wants to negotiate with It. Therefore I consider it my duty to explain subordinately to Your Eminence my humble opinion about the adoption or not of these conditions at the current time.

<p>It is essential to recognize, first of all, that from a legal perspective the present situation is better than the past. In fact, the Government of Kurt Eisner was not only merely provisional and de facto, but also illegitimate even from a democratic point of view, in that, as clearly shown by the elections, it was not representative of the Bavarian people, but only of a small revolutionary minority. It was primarily for this reason that I did not believe I could enter into relations with it and thus courteously declined the proposal of a meeting, which, moreover, would have caused sadness and scandal among Catholics, as I had the honor to report to Your Eminence in my Respectful Report No. 10941 dated November 20, 1918. By contrast, the current Ministry presided over by Mr. Hoffmann had the approbation of the Landtag, being the legal representative of the Bavarian people, even though the non-Socialist parties, especially the Bavarian People’s Party (Center Party), were induced rather begrudgingly and under the pressure of events (cf. Reports Nos 12334 and 12335 of March 18 and 19, 1919). Keeping in mind, moreover, that any attempt to restore the monarchy would have been, at least for now, certainly doomed to failure and would have done nothing but provoke civil war, it seems obligatory to conclude that the current Government can be considered as legitimate and thus one with which it is licit to enter into official relations.

<p>On the other hand, however, it needs to be observed:

<p>1st) that the current Government can be called durable only in the sense that it is per se some type of legitimately constituted Ministry for so long as it remains in fact in power. But since in the current state of political and social ferment, especially in Bavaria, no one can with absolute certainty predict what will happen tomorrow, and moreover there is a universal conviction that the Hoffmann Cabinet (like in general the Majority Socialists to which he has belonged up to now) may lose ground one day and that the country is on the eve of a third revolution that will tend to establish a Councils Republic according to the Russian system.

<p>2nd) The Hoffmann Ministry, even if it is more moderate from a social policy perspective than the Independent Socialist Kurt Eisner, nonetheless, according to the unanimous information I am receiving, harbors a profound aversion to religion, so much that it can be said that its strongest struggle, in the issue of schooling, has been the supreme ideal of its life. For the moment it is abstaining, as it seems, from hostile acts, since it feels the ground shaking too much under its feet and because the Bavarian People’s Party (Center Party), in the negotiations that preceded the formation of the current Cabinet Ministry, made it a condition that the religious question be left untouched. From such a man it is difficult to expect that he will want to deal in a satisfactory way with the Holy See to resolve the ecclesiastical situation. I must add that I did not fail to make efforts prudently to enter into relations with him in an appropriate way, especially via the head of the Bavarian Center Party, Dr. Speck, an excellent Catholic; but up to now in vain. Also, according to what the Archbishop has reported to me, when an official of the Education Ministry suggested to Hoffmann that he open relations with the Nunciature or with the Holy See precisely to systematize the issue of the parish appointments, he responded that there was no need.

<p>3rd) Finally, there are many indications predicting that there will probably be a separation of Church and State in Germany, to which the Commission discussing the new Reich Constitution in Weimar is favorable (but in a non-hostile form). Separation, then, will take place with certainty, everyone believes, if Bolshevism prevails and the Councils Republic is established. In that case the issue of the right of presentation as to benefices by the governing authorities would fall away by itself.
<p>That said, I leave it to Your Eminence’s superior judgment to decide whether it would be useful now to negotiate with the Bavarian Government to resolve the issue of the appointment of parish pastors, or whether it would be more expedient for now to await a solution of the current political and social crises, perhaps tolerating provisionally that the Bishops, to the extent they consider it necessary, would present the required three-candidate lists to the current Government, as was done in the past, without bringing the Holy See into the question or compromising it.

<p>Therefore, in expectation of the venerated instructions that Your Eminence may be pleased to communicate to me, possibly by telegraph, I humbly bow to kiss the Sacred Purple ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Re: The Nunciature and the Soviets-Councils Republic of Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence:

<p>As I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my encrypted cable No. 319, at the beginning of this week two Foreign Legations in Munich were invaded by the red guard of the Councils Republic.  Afterward, the automobile of the Prussian Legation came to be requisitioned, and the Consul General of Austria-Hungary was then arbitrarily arrested, and was not released until strong protests from the Austro-Hungarian Chargé d’Affaires.

<p>As a result of such deplorable events, it was deemed opportune to call a meeting of the Diplomatic Corps to deliberate about them.  After a long discussion, it was decided to speak about the matter directly with Levien, head of the Munich Councils Republic, to make him state unequivocally whether and how the current Communist Government intends to recognize and protect the immunities of the Diplomatic Representations.  The negotiations were entrusted to the Nunciature and the Prussian Legation.  Since it would have been absolutely indecorous for me to present myself to the aforesaid gentleman, the task was given to Monsignor Auditor, who went to him this morning together with the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires, Count von Zech, as the Ambassador was away from Munich in view of the current circumstances.

<p>Levien was installed along with his General Staff, or if you please, with the Council of Representatives of the people, in the former royal palace of the Wittelsbachs. The spectacle that said palace now presents is indescribable.  The most chaotic confusion, the most nauseating filth, the continual coming and going of soldiers and armed workers, the shouting, the obscene language, the blasphemies that resound there, are turning what was the favorite residence of the King of Bavaria into a real hell-hole.  An army of office workers who come and go, who transmit orders and pass along news, among them a crowd of young women, of a hardly reassuring appearance, Jews like the first ones, who are in all the offices, with provocative airs and equivocal smiles.  The leader of this group of women there is Levien’s lover: a young Russian woman, Jewish, divorced, who gives orders like the mistress of the house.  And to her the Nunciature unfortunately had to bow down to have a ticket for entry!

<p>Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew, of about thirty or thirty-five years.  Pallid, dirty, with dull eyes, with a gruff, vulgar voice: a truly repulsive type, yet with an intelligent and sly face.  He barely deigned to receive Monsignor Auditor in a corridor, surrounded by an armed security detail, among them an armed hunchback who is his faithful bodyguard.  With a hat on his head and smoking, he listened to what Monsignor Schioppa expressed to him, protesting repeatedly and rudely that he was in a hurry for more urgent matters.  In a contemptuous tone, he said the Councils Republic recognizes the extraterritoriality of the Foreign Legations, if and so long as the representatives of the Powers, friendly or hostile (it doesn’t matter to him), take no actions against the Councils Republic.

<p>When the Auditor made him consider that the position of the Pontifical Representative deserves special regard for his Mission, Levien stressed with a certain ironic tone: “Right, it’s about protecting the Center Party!” To which Monsignor Schioppa added energetically that it is about protecting the religious interests of Catholics, not only of Bavaria but of all Germany!

<p>At the conclusion of the discussion he sent the Auditor to his <em>comrade</em> Dietrich, the People’s Representative for Foreign Affairs; there was another crowd of damsels, soldiers and workers; more disorderly conduct, more chaos. This improvisational Foreign Minister was a little less rude, but more sharp in his responses.  Essentially he repeated what Levien had said, adding, in a way that admitted no discussion, that if the Nuncio did anything against the Councils Republic or the interests of the proletariat, he would be “<em>thrown out</em>” (weggeworfen), and he repeated the phrase, already spoken by Levien, that they <em>had no need of the Nunciature</em>, all the more since separation of State and Church would be coming.  Monsignor Schioppa made them aware that, if the Republic were to hurt Catholic interests, the Nuncio would betray his Mission by remaining silent, but that naturally, otherwise, the Pontifical Representative would not get involved in political matters of the province.  Dietrich insisted that extraterritoriality will be respected, so long as the security of the Councils Republic is not threatened.  In any case documents are conceded to the Nunciature just as to the other Legations, in which the same extraterritoriality is recognized. It is clear that these documents only possess a rather relative value.  Similar documents had already been issued to Diplomatic and Consular Representatives in Bavaria, and yet that did not prevent the invasion of the two Legations described above, nor the arrest of the Austrian Consul. The interpretation of these documents, given the complete anarchy that reigns, is left to the soldiers, who can go wherever they want with impunity and can do whatever best pleases them.  There may be some soldiers who have the good sense and capacity to understand that extraterritoriality* is an important matter, but it is clear that the majority do not understand one iota, insisting on searching and arresting, and only after this is done is it possible to invoke the protection of the commissars of the people.

<p>This is the unprecedented situation created for the Apostolic Nuncio, who then for possible further negotiations is obliged to submit to the indecorous humiliation of going back again to these Authorities in such offices.

<p>In reporting the above to Your Eminence, as in duty bound, and in discharging my responsibilities, humbly bowing and kissing the Sacred Purple, and with sentiments of most profound veneration, I have the honor to remain,

<p>Your Most Reverend Eminence’s 

<p>Most Humble, Most Devoted, Most Obliged Servant,

<p>*Note: Extraterritoriality of the Nunciature, under the circumstances, was confusing for international lawyers as well as Red Army soldiers: The Nunciature’s diplomatic immunity flowed from its status as an extraterritorial property of a sovereign nation. But the Pope’s temporal sovereignty over the Papal States had been lost during the period 1859-1870, and the Pope did not again rule a sovereign nation until Mussolini’s recognition of the Vatican City State in the Lateran Accords of 1929.

<blockquote>Re: Aggressions against the Nunciature

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Yesterday, Tuesday April 29th, a little after 3:00 p.m., the Commander of the Red Army of the South, Seyler, came to the Nunciature with his adjutant Brongratz and other soldiers armed with rifles, revolvers and hand grenades. After having intimidated, with the threat to explode the selfsame grenades, the servant of the Nunciature who had opened the door to them, they entered by force, stating that they wanted to seize the Nunciature’s automobile (a splendid car with the pontifical coat of arms), and demanded to speak immediately with the Nuncio. Monsignor Auditor being away from the house at that moment, I presented myself to these raving men and made known to the Commander that the violent penetration into the Nunciature and the requisitioning of the automobile by force of arms constituted two flagrant violations of international law binding on all civilized peoples, and I further showed him the certificate of extraterritoriality issued by the People’s Commission for Foreign Affairs, of which I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful Report No. 12572. For his entire response the adjutant aimed the revolver at my chest, and the Commander – a horrible delinquent type – after having given his underlings the order to hold hand grenades at the ready, told me insolently that any talk was useless and that he had to have the automobile immediately to proceed to the front. I replied with vigor that I was protesting against the aggression, but that, in the face of brutal violence, I was permitting the aforesaid servant to open the <em>garage</em>.

<p>Seyler then proceeded there, and, thanks to the help of a <em>chauffeur</em> who came with him, tried to put the automobile in motion; an arduous task, since the Nunciature’s <em>chauffeur</em>, in anticipation of the event, had removed from the machine an essential piece for its functioning. While these delinquents, infuriated by encountering the obstacle, were intent on their work, I had a telephone call made to the competent Ministry of Military Affairs. The response, however, was hardly encouraging: If the automobile was not immediately handed over, the Nunciature would be bombarded and the whole band (sic, in original), that is the personnel of the selfsame Nunciature, would be arrested. This attempt having failed, and despite the difficulty deriving from the fact that an armed sentinel was watching over the telephone, I succeeded in having Monsignor Schioppa alerted, in order to try a step with the Commander of the City. He indeed, engaged immediately by Monsignor Schioppa, understood the situation; and towards five, that is two whole hours after the Nunciature had been invaded, three security agents arrived and ordered the Commander of the Red Guard to desist from his enterprise. Given, however, that he, as a member of the Supreme Command, maintained that he did not have to submit to orders from the Commander of the City, there arose between the two parties a loud argument, until, as it pleased God, at 6 o’clock, as a result of new instructions from other Authorities, Seyler undertook to go away, leaving the automobile. Thus quiet returned to the Nunciature, but only for a short time.

<p>This morning I was in Prof. Jochner’s Clinic, where, having recently had a strong attack of influenza and a sick stomach, I am undergoing a special treatment. Monsignor Schioppa was in the Nunciature. Toward 9:00, the same two individuals reappeared, that is the Commander of the Red Army of the South and his adjutant, accompanied by other armed soldiers and equipped with a document signed by Egelhofer, Supreme Commander of the Red Army, which authorized them to requisition the Nunciature’s automobile.

<p>Immediately the Executive Committee, as well as the Commander of the City, were alerted by telephone. Indeed there arrived at the Nunciature, with all speed in two automobiles, a member of the aforesaid Committee with armed soldiers, and in another automobile, about ten soldiers of the City Command’s police. An agitated discussion arose about the jurisdiction of the powers, and the matter threatened to go on for an eternity and perhaps end badly; when it was proposed that the two who came for the requisitioning go together with the member of the Executive Committee to Egelhofer. After more than a short wait, they returned in an automobile, this furnished with a machinegun and a not inconsiderable number of soldiers with rifles and hand grenades. The member of the Executive Committee then told Monsignor Auditor that this Committee could not do anything at all to avert the seizure of the automobile, as it concerned a matter of a military character. The soldiers from the City Command made the same statement, adding that they could well have undertaken a struggle by armed force against those of the Red Army, but that it was more humane to spare the shedding of blood.

<p>Monsignor Schioppa protested with the greatest vigor against the act of violence that they wanted to commit, making it known, among other things, that even in Russia and Hungary the prerogatives of the Diplomatic Corps were respected and that it is impossible to understand how members of the Executive Committee and soldiers of the Councils Republic would not respect the decisions and signatures of their Ministers, who had recognized the extraterritoriality of the Nunciature. At this point, the Commander of the Red Army of the South, with an imperious and arrogant tone, turned to Monsignor Auditor and said to him: “Not one word more; otherwise you will be arrested at this very moment!” At this threat he needed to yield, but not before Monsignor Schioppa had first made clearly known that the yielding was only in the face of violence and that the Executive Committee would be responsible for the consequences of this act of violation of international law.

<p>While they were proceeding to take away the automobile, however, the Italian Army Captain, Signor De Luca, detached to Munich by the Military Mission in Berlin, and an excellent Gentleman, having learned what was happening, went to the Supreme Command of the Red Army, and (of his own initiative, indeed unknown to the Nunciature) demanded the release of the automobile in the name of the Italian Government, protesting against what had occurred. The step had a happy result, as Egelhofer gave an order to the aforesaid Captain for the immediate release of the car, which has already been taken to the Benz Company garage for appropriate repairs. There Egelhofer’s order was shown, before which the two who came for the requisitioning had to yield, not without first bringing menacing words of rancor to their lips, among them that the whole band (the Nunciature) should be thrown into prison! 

<p>Indeed the Italian attaché at the Swiss Consulate (who was in charge of the protection of Italians during the war), having become aware of the matter, went to the Executive Committee and had from them a letter of apology for what had happened to the Nunciature, and the assurance that the deplorable event would not be repeated, as well as confirmation of what the Commander in charge of the Red Army had already said to Captain De Luca.

<p>Thus the automobile could be returned to the Nunciature with rubber tires that had also been required: but there remains the act of violence against the Pontifical Representative, the violation of the right of extraterritoriality and the threats of abuse against the Nunciature, which, given the state of exceptional excitement that reigns here and the double game played by the Commander of the Red Army of the South and his worthy adjutant, there could be attempts, and therefore I as well as Monsignor Auditor have been advised to sleep away from the house for several nights, naturally leaving the palace of the Nunciature well watched after.

<p>An event developed into an echo of cannons, which reverberated yesterday almost uninterruptedly in Munich, in the fratricidal fighting between the Red Army of the Councils Republic and the White Army fighting for the liberation of the Capital of Bavaria from the harshest Russian-Jewish-revolutionary tyranny.

<blockquote>“Demands of the Non-Socialist Parties”

<p>On the afternoon of Saturday, May 3rd, the representatives of the Bavarian Volkspartei Munich, the German Democratic Party, the National Liberal Party and the City Council of Munich, together with the associated economic leagues, submitted the following demands to the military supreme command:

<p>1. Immediate re-establishment of lawful conditions by the annulment of all of the Räteregierung’s decreed orders.

<p>2. Expeditious resumption of a regular police force to provide security for public order, personal liberty and economic life.

<p>3. Disarming of the Red Army and the Worker Defense Force, dissolution of the Munich Troop Detachment and a prohibition on bearing of arms by the civilian population.

<p>4. The setting up of a trustworthy, well-disciplined popular army under the leadership of professional soldiers.

<p>5. Thoroughgoing measures for the securing of the democratic constitution, the Landtag and the Government formed by it, in particular by the prevention of any further propaganda verbally and writing for the dictatorship of a class.

<p>6. Arrest of the leaders responsible for the unlawful events and their referral to the regular courts, to the extent that an immediate strictest penalty has not already necessarily been carried out upon the murderers of the hostages and upon all plunderers.
<p>7. Expulsion of all elements foreign to our State that are not politically irreproachable.

<p>In consideration of the catastrophic impact of recent events for the political, moral and economic life of Munich, it was the desire of the undersigned organizations to submit these demands jointly with the Social Democratic Party. It, however, could not join in our activity. We regret now having to make our demands without the Social Democratic Party; but we are nevertheless convinced that the demands of that party substantially correspond with ours.

<p>The named organizations expressly declare that our special action, required by the aforementioned events, shall not mean the formation of any sort of anti-Socialist or anti-proletarian bloc; each one of the undersigned organizations shall rather remain independent in the preservation of its own direction in accordance with its otherwise programmatic position.

<p>As we are informed, the demands were already submitted on Saturday, May 3rd to the powers that be, by representatives of the Action Committee. These representatives were informed that a portion of the demands have already been put into implementation, and that the rest of the demands would succeed in short order.</blockquote>

<a name="9e"></a><p><strong>May 5, 1919</strong> Nuncio Pacelli’s report to Cardinal Gasparri about machinegun fire upon the Nunciature and invasion of the Nunciature by anti-Communist forces: 

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>After the aggressions by the Red Army that I reported to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful report No. 12602, there was an attack here by Government troops against the palace of the Nunciature on the evening of May 3rd. I was at Prof. Jochner’s Clinic in Munich, where I also spent the night. Monsignor Schioppa had also slept away from the house the night before, at the place of a friend of his from the Austrian Legation, and that same evening I strongly recommended that he do the same.  Having returned to the Nunciature at 7 p.m. for dinner, however, he did not believe he could go out again without danger, and thus deemed it safer to remain there. Unfortunately, however, toward 10 o’clock, after a loud shout was heard in the street where the Nunciature palace is situated, apparently a military order, a violent fusillade of rifle and machinegun fire struck against the palace itself, and precisely against the eastern side with the room occupied by Monsignor Auditor. He was in the bedroom and had just then turned on the electric light. With the tremendous shots that were discharged against the room, he thought perhaps the light could have provoked this devilry, though there was no order against it.  He wanted to turn it off immediately but found that was impossible to do without grave danger, since the light switch was right in front of the window where bullets were coming in.  Finally, crawling on all fours across the floor, he succeeded in turning off the light and taking refuge in another room.  After a few more minutes, the fusillade ceased. At the same time, three officers and about twenty soldiers came to the door, Government troops (Prussian), armed with rifles, hand grenades and revolvers, and said that there had been repeated shots from the windows of the Nunciature directed at the troops, killing at least four soldiers, and therefore they wanted to make a thorough search of the house.  Monsignor Schioppa, after expressing appropriate misgivings in consideration of the diplomatic immunity to which the house was entitled, accompanied the officers and soldiers into all the rooms and even onto the roof, to convince them that there were no Spartacists in the building and that there was necessarily no possibility that troops had been fired upon from there.  It was not easy to convince these gentlemen, who asserted that at least two sentries had reported the fact of firing from the windows of the palace.  By God’s will, half an hour after midnight, the soldiers left the house, with two sentries remaining there on watch to see if anyone might shoot from dwellings overlooking the garden of the Nunciature.  In fact the Spartacists, after losing the major battle, began to fight as guerrillas from the roofs, as their worthy comrades had done in Berlin.

<p>The morning after, it was possible to confirm the severity of the attack that had been suffered.  On the exterior walls of the house on the aforementioned side, there are at least fifty or sixty holes made by machinegun bullets.  Several window panes are shattered. Two bullets penetrated the interior wall against which Msgr. Auditor’s bed is set.  Four shots struck the interior of his bathroom, which is severely damaged, and it was a miracle that one of the bullets did not strike the gas line, which could have caused an immense calamity.

<p>On the same day, I did not fail to call these deplorable events to the attention of the Prussian Legation in Munich, which promised to take an interest so that such events do not recur.  Meanwhile, last night another attack was renewed against a house near the Nunciature, and it was a real marvel if it was spared new damage.

<p>“Martial Law and Death”

<p>“The Bavarian Government has declared war conditions and martial law. Whoever goes upo against Government troops with a weapon in hand will be punished by death. All armed resistance will be relentlessly broken by force of arms. Every member of the Red Army will be treated as an enemy of the Bavarian people and the German Government.” So reads the declaration that was announced by the Bavarian Government and the military supreme command upon the entry of Government troops.

<p>Everyone who longs for the return of law and order after the criminal offenses of the recent wielders of power has recognized the unconditional necessity of these measures...</p><br>

<p>“Political Developments and the Bavarian Volkspartei”

<p>After lawful governmental conditions had been made clear by statements of the Government, the Landtag and the individual parties, necessary measures had to be taken under consideration and tried in action. The main problem to be solved initially was to build the foundation of a reliable armed force that can support the Government under all circumstances. The sad experiences of recent days had opened the eyes of all who did not want to believe it before, that even a Socialist Government, just like any other, whatever name it goes by, simply hangs in the air if it does not have the necessary material and military means of power at its disposal. Under the force of circumstances, the Government has finally stepped up to appeal for the formation of a reliable people’s defense force from all elements of the population without consideration of what party or organization they   belong to.  It is to the exceptional credit of the bourgeois parties, and first of all the Bavarian Volkspartei, to have shown the way for the Government in this direction. As the Government agreed on April 18th to the formation of Freikorps units, the final hindrance was removed that had stood in the way of the raising of a serviceable Government armed force.

<p>Hand in hand with the demand for setting up a people’s army was the request for the immediate extensive arming of the countryside for defense against Spartacist plundering bands from the cities.  This demand, which our party placed the greatest weight on fulfilling, was carried out by a Government decree by which the police stations, upon demand, should receive weaponry and ammunition as much as needed for farmers who reported to bear arms. In the same category also belongs the establishment and reinforcement of the State military police...</blockquote>

<p>We were standing at the abyss! Apparently not everyone today is yet fully conscious of that.  And many, it seems to me, have let what happened today erase the memory of yesterday. I do not want to write about the atrocities committed by Bolshevik rage against innocent victims - but, Munichers, have you forgotten that even your priests were no longer secure against vilifications of the worst type on the streets and byways, that they were openly called “enemies of the people” and placed in the same category as war profiteers, that they tried three times to arrest your Archbishop, who was fortunately not then in his palace, that many other priests were also placed on the “blacklist,” that priests were actually arrested who were guilty of nothing, and they were only released when citizens valiantly demanded their release?  Have you forgotten that monasteries and institutions, which fed so many poor and sick and children during the war, often at great sacrifice, were robbed and plundered, and in some cases like the Capuchins had everything taken down to the last potato ... Munichers, do not forget what was done to your priests and monasteries!  And do not forget who brought these intolerable conditions to an end! Be thankful also to our North German brethren, who in league with the South German troops restored peace and calm to us. If we had been left to our own resources, we would be lost today... Stand up against all uncertain, untrue rumors, do not believe everything that is said, approach our saviors with love and friendship - they have truly served us! - Munichers, be thankful!

<blockquote>“Separation of Church and State in France”

<p>Totally opposite to the American separation of Church and State, of which we spoke in our last issue, is the separation of church and state in France.  Hostility to religion, hatred of the Church, and Freemasonry have brought the French Separation Law into existence.  From that it is clear at the outset that this separation is no work of peace, but rather a frightful weapon intended to stab right at the heart of Catholicism in France.  Thus the Pope has identified this law not as a “separation-, but rather an oppression-law against the Church,” whose goal is to “de-Catholicize France.”  The Separation Law of December 9, 1905 encompasses an official falling away from God and the Church, an enslaving and suppression of the Church and a monstrous theft of Church property.

<p>For decades Freemason Lodges, freethinkers, and socialism have worked for this separation for the purpose of de-Catholicizing France.  The French nation is supposed to foreswear all religion in their laws, in their political, social and civil life.  “Religion must be combatted like alcoholism, tuberculosis or the bubonic plague,” explained a Freemasonic member of parliament in the debates ...

<p>The separation of Church and State in the French-Freemasonic manner is thus a public theft that cries out to heaven, a sacrilegious robbery carried out by law.  All churches, with their property, rectories, bishops’ residences and seminaries are declared to be state property.

<p>Public morals, law and economic life have suffered severe harm by war and revolution.

They must help to create a representation that acts for the good of the productive classes in city and countryside, with Christian social concepts and intention, building a new world from the ground up, upon the rubble…

<p>Our active concern pertains to the professional and commercial middle class, to the farmers, workers and employees. Our standing up for health care, especially care for children and infants, and for orderly provision of food and appropriate nutrition, serves the common good.

<p>Regarding the provision of welfare, we want to pay special attention to preserving the character of local institutions, to comprehensive care for the poor, to relieving the shortage of housing, and to special consideration in public employment for those disabled in the war.

<p>We turn our constant concern to the formation and education of our youth on the time-tested confessional foundation, especially in soundly established schools with free tuition and free learning materials for those of modest means.

<p>For the implementation of this program, vote for the men and women on our candidate list, who share an active will for working and for self-sacrificially doing their part!

<blockquote>“The Burial of the 21”

<p>Outdoors in the quiet Moosach cemetery far from the big city, the final act of the bloody drama was carried out on Saturday afternoon as the mortal remains of the 21 young men, once full of hope, were laid to rest in consecrated ground. Just as the widest circles had first participated in hearing the news of this heavy stroke of fate, so an enormous crowd of people had come to the cemetery to pay their last respects to the deceased…

<p>... Fr. Rupert Mayer addressed the grieving assembly at the burial with the following words:
“Dear Parents, Wives and Siblings! Dear Members!”

<p>I experienced much during my 2-1/2 years in the field … But nothing so shook and shattered me as the terrible news of what occurred here...

<p>What above all causes us grief and makes the entire matter so flagrant is the fact that innocent, harmless, beloved, good people so suddenly and violently lost their lives in such a horrible manner. We want it established in the broadest public light of day that these beloved deceased had not the least unlawful act to their charge. Anyone who speaks or writes to the contrary, speaks and writes what is not in accord with the facts. That is what makes the heart pound so.

<p>It is understandable is the heart rages at the first moment and thoughts of hatred want to well up in us against those who have committed such a terrible crime against us. But that was only for a moment and can only be for a moment: for we are believing Christians and want to be upright, believing followers of Jesus Christ. We rejoice that we may hold high the commandment to love. Therefore away with every thought of hatred and revenge...

<p>There is yet another thought that could bring this terrible matter into a somewhat brighter light: Couldn’t this sacrifice perhaps become a means toward reconciliation of these otherwise so irreconcilable oppositions that we saw come presently to pass? … If the blood that was shed here, if the sacrificial death of their sons and brothers would serve as a bridge over the powerful divide in our people, then that would be a great consolation for the survivors...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Paragraph 1 begins by acknowledging the “manifestations of disorder and of anarchy which have recently occurred among you and among neighboring countries.”

<p>Para. 9 describes Boniface’s conduct in the terms of a model Apostolic Nuncio:  “Right from the beginning of his mission, he communicated with the Holy See via letters and messengers,” “he made known to the venerable Apostolic Father everything which the grace of God accomplished by his means” and he “sought advice from the Holy See in matters which concerned the daily needs of the Church of God and of the people’s welfare.” (quoting from Willibald’s Life of St. Boniface) 

<p>Para. 12:  Pope Gregory II invited German rulers and people to give Boniface “their approval and their co-operation to such a great servant of God, sent by the Catholic and Apostolic Church to enlighten the nations.”

<p>Paragraphs 10 through 22 repeatedly emphasize the values of fidelity to Rome and close ties of filial devotion and obedience to the Pope.  Para. 18 recalls how Boniface enjoyed calling himself “the German representative of the Holy Roman Church.”  Paragraph 22 applies that concept to the current day, saying that Boniface lives among the German people today as “the representative of the Roman Catholic Church for Germany.”  Paragraph 25 indicates that the mission of Rome’s representative to Germany includes building relations with France as well:  “The apostle of Germany thus charitably embraced the neighboring nation of the Franks.”

<p>Para. 26:  “We long for the day when the rights of Almighty God and of the Church, their laws, their worship and their authority will be restored in this troubled world.  We hope that then Christian charity will end wars and furious hatreds, dissensions, schisms, and the errors which crawl everywhere.  May it link the peoples by a more stable treaty than the transient pacts of men.  Its special means toward this goal are the unity of faith and the ancient union with the Holy See.”</blockquote><br>

<a name="11b"></a><p><strong>May 15, 1919</strong> Memorandum by Faulhaber:

<blockquote>As the unbearably harsh peace terms became known on May 10th, I directed the following telegraphic question to the Bavarian Bishops: “Do Your Bishop-Graces give their agreement to implore His Holiness, in the name of the Bavarian Episcopacy, for an amelioration of the peace terms?” With the exception of Speyer, whose Bishop was apparently not handed the question by the French occupation troops, all Bishops answered affirmatively.

<p>My fullest agreement and thanks. Maximilian of Augsburg.

<p>Gladly give my agreement. Bishop Schloer of Würzburg.

<p>Agree, and wanted myself to suggest the entire Episcopate of Germany to implore the Pope. Archbishop Hauck of Bamberg.

<p>To the received request I give my fullest agreement. Bishop of Passau.

<p>Fullest agreement. I wish the best of success. Leo of Eichstätt.

<p>Consented. Bishop of Regensburg.

<p>The last of these answers arrived in Munich right after my confirmations trip, on Tuesday, May 13th. Right on the evening of May 13th I personally brought over to the Lord Nuncio Pacelli the request that the Holy Father might paternally intervene, with the high respect in which he is held by the hostile governments, that the harsh peace terms be ameliorated. The request was grounded first of all in that such a dictated peace would create not a foundation of peace but a foundation of eternal hatred, would deliver the life of nations over to unimaginable internal upheavals, and would consign the League of Nations, which the Holy Father already during the war indicated as a goal of development and guarantee of peace, to the realm of impossibility.

<p>The Lord Nuncio promised me with the greatest cordiality to convey this request, which had already reached him by telegram from three northern German Bishops, and to convey it anew by telegraph in the name of the Bavarian Bishops to the Holy Father.

<p>In the same matter, the following telegraph from Reich Minister Erzberger in Berlin arrived for the Archbishop of Munich: “I would like to submit the following suggestion to Your Archbishop-Grace: The enemies’ peace terms are unbearable and unfulfillable for the German people; it is the duty of the leaders of the people to bring this most urgently to the attention of each and every one of the people. Upon the most reverend Lord Bishops, as the spiritual shepherds and teachers of the Catholic people, thus falls the task in these difficult days of the Fatherland, to do your part, upheld by the respect of your holy office, so that every German Catholic becomes aware of the enormous implications that this type of peace, which our enemies want to force upon us, must have for the future of Germany and thereby for the future of the Catholic Church in Germany. All hearts must be brought to prayerful soul-searching and insight as to the gravity of our situation. In order to seek comfort and strength in looking trustingly to God, we need the encouraging word of our Bishops and our clergy. In this prayer, our clergy would have to point out with serious words the unbearable difficulty of these expected peace terms and unite themselves with the faithful in imploring God that he might preserve us from these bonds that are unworthy of a free people. I urgently appeal to the heart of Your Archbishop-Grace with these thoughts and for their expeditious implementation. The Catholic people are justified, in these sad days, to expect an appeal in the voice of their shepherds, and the Church is obligated to announce, in an appropriate and reasonable manner, its participation in the grief of the country, as it previously expressed in the order of a week of silence with the Reich Government. The same telegram has gone out to all the Lord Archbishops and Bishops of the Reich.”

<p>In answer to this telegram, I wired back: “The Bavarian Episcopate has already implored Pope Benedict to intervene for ameliorated peace terms.”

<p>On the evening of May 15th I spoke with Vicar General Huber: Since printing and distribution of an official notice is no longer possible, it shall be made known through the daily press that next Sunday, May 18th, is to be observed as a day of prayer for peace by exposition of the Blessed Sacrament and corresponding devotions.

<blockquote>“To the Bavarian People!”

<p>After an enormous struggle of more than 50 months, Germany with its allies is put down by a world of enemies. Heroic deeds of sacrifice and courage like the world has never seen have been carried out by our people. Our Bavarian troops have fought honorably, shoulder to shoulder with our fellow German brethren on all the battlefields of this dreadful war, and have won undying laurels upon their flags.

<p>... Deprived of the support of our allies, exhausted by the results of a merciless starvation blockade and deprived of the means to continue the war that had been successfully conducted for years, Germany, trusting in the promises of President Wilson, acknowledged the well-known 14 Points as the foundation of a lasting peace and accepted the harsh and hardly implementable conditions of the Armistice that made us defenseless.  

<p><strong>The trust in the humanity and justice of our honorably regarded adversaries was most cruelly disappointed...</strong>

<p>The 7th of May 1919 has become, by the transmittal of these inhuman peace conditions, a day of misfortune not only for the German people, but for the entire world.  For on this day the spirit of revenge and violence won a victory over justice and humanity, and violated the conscience of humanity in the bloodiest way.

<p><strong>More than in fortunate days must now the entire people stand together as a single band of brothers. The ruining of our people must come to an end and domestic strife may no longer rip brother from brother. Our difficult lot, our unfathomable subjection to violence, must be borne by us together, as together we set up against the overpowering foe the dignity of a people that has no doubt in itself. In these days of national mourning, we Bavarians want to be entirely united, but united also with our brethren in the whole German Reich, with which Bavaria has grown up together not only in happy days but also in difficult ones.</strong>

<blockquote>Emir Feisal received by the Pope – On April 25th, His Holiness Benedict XV received in private audience His Highness Emir Feisal, son of the King of Hedjaz, who, accompanied by the Count of Salis, the British Minister to the Vatican, and the Procurator General of the Maronites, Father Abate Ubaid, who served as interpreter, was presented to the Holy Father dressed in Middle Eastern attire.  He had arrived in Rome the day before from Paris, where he represented his country at the Peace Conference; Hedjaz had already taken part in the War on the side of the Entente, and thus it wanted to take part in the spoils of victory.  Hedjaz, as is known, is that arm of Arabia that extends along the shore of the Red Sea, along a wide stretch from north to south, encompassing the two holy cities of the Muslims, Medina and Mecca, and the two ports of Yanbu and Jeddah, which are the respective gateways to the two cities.  Before the war the region was part of the Turkish Empire and was governed in the name of the Sultan by the Sheriff of Mecca; but when Turkey entered the war in alliance with Germany and Austria, the Sheriff for his part declined, and then declared himself for the Entente, calling the country to arms and bringing such rapid and resounding success that he was acclaimed king, and thus the Kingdom of Hedjaz was born.  Now Emir Feisal is the son of this king, the third-born son, but greater than the others by the valor he displayed especially in the victorious march from Aqaba (Sinai peninsula) to Syria; and for this reason he was also given preference over the others to come to the Paris Conference to advocate for the claims of the new kingdom.
His stay in Rome was brief; he visited the main monuments there, then left for the Middle East.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“From November to May”

<p>In a memorable appeal from the night of November 8, 1918, Kurt Eisner, who by the testimony of Herr. Dr. Benno Merkle “since December 1917 ... was trying, by inciting the German proletariat into labor strikes, to bring the war to a conclusion,” declared the following:

<p> “If, however, a revolutionary government now arises in Bavaria, whose driving forces have fought in lonely, dangerous opposition against German war policy from the war’s commencement on,  then we can trust that such a government will instill a different impression in the American President and release a milder attitude than would be the case with a government that has taken upon itself all the responsibility for the past... 

<p>And in the government program of the revolutionary government, that is, in the program of the entire government including the Majority Socialists, it reads: <strong>“The leading men of the Entente speak differently after the revolution than before. Our appeal to the conscience of the world did not go unheard… The spirit of the patriot who leads the French Republic speaks today with humanitarian understanding and trust ... We have confidence today that thanks to our both revolutionary and prudent policy, our concept of restoration expressed in that Note to the Entente (sent by Eisner) will bear fruit with them so that the League of Nations will have to be built in cooperative work of the enemies for overcoming the destruction of the war.”</strong>

<p>In his speech to the Bavarian Soldiers Councils on November 30, 1918, Kurt Eisner further said: “Even in the Entente the people want peace, even there the soldiers want to go home, <strong> even there they want to arrive at new circumstances just as we do ... We have to negotiate with the Entente as if the war never was,</strong> as if we are men who long to work in peace at last.”  There can be no talk, assured the then Minister President in his speech before the Munich Workers, Soldiers and Farmers Council on Nov. 28, 1918, based on “authentic” confirmations, <strong>“that the Entente is thinking of restarting a war with us … No, my men, I vouch for this: At the moment when Germany has a government capable of action, which enjoys trust so that the masses as well stand behind it as it now honorably and openly wants to conclude a peace, at that same moment we will have peace.”</strong>

<p>We now have the peace terms of the Entente, we now know what “trust” our adversaries have given to the “driving forces” of the revolution, we have learned what resonance the “appeal to the conscience of the world” has found; we have had the opportunity to assess the “spirit of the patriot who leads the French Republic” and his “humanitarian understanding.” We have seen where it leads when we negotiate with the Entente “as if no further war would be conducted.” We have come to know the treatment that the peace question has experienced through the “revolution.” We have received the irrefutable evidence of what we have to thank for the “both revolutionary and prudent policy” of the “driving forces of the revolution.”

<p>The Social Democratic party was, according to the January 1st election appeal of the leadership of the S.P. of Germany, “always revolutionary in the sense of striving for the complete transformation of the State into a democracy, and the economy into Socialism”; by a completed revolution it had “in foreign affairs, directed its entire effort toward setting in motion the moral powers of the world, the powers of Socialism, in order to achieve through its struggle a lasting peace that is bearable for the German people, despite the defeat for which the former government authorities are responsible.”

<p>Now we have come to know the effects of the revolution both in domestic and foreign affairs, like the effectiveness of the Socialistic powers that were set in motion for a bearable world peace.</blockquote>

<a name="11f"></a><p>Also on page one of the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em> on May 17:

<blockquote>“The ‘Echo de Paris’ and the Bavarian Embassy to the Vatican”

<p>Under the headline, “The Vatican Shakes Off a Bavarian Document,” the <em>Stampa</em> of Turin reports that a “prominent Church personality who occupies an official post in the Vatican” has authorized the Roman correspondent of the <em>Echo de Paris</em>, in the course of an interview, to deny categorically an assertion that the Bavarian Ambassador to the Holy See in a communiqué sent to his government, is supposed to have or had made. Fechenbach (the <em>Stampa</em>, to give new proof of its reliable reporting, calls him “Fehrenbach”), the Secretary of Herr Eisner, had published, that is to say, a report of Baron Ritter to his government in 1914, which affirmed that “the Vatican reckons with certainty upon Austria’s strong concerted action against Serbia, which has been shown all too guilty against Austria.” (Thus the <em>Stampa</em>!) It should be absolutely erroneous that the Holy See would have encouraged Austria-Hungary to invade Serbia to prevent the same crushing of Austria. “It is impossible to accept,” said the aforementioned Prelate, “that the Vatican had taken such a step and could have desired the disappearance of Serbia, if one is familiar with the political ideas of Pius X, who maintained excellent relations with the Serbian Government, for it was right during his Pontificate that the Concordat was concluded.”

<p>It has to be doubted that any competent personality in the Vatican would choose such a paper as the <em>Echo de Paris</em> for such a semi-official announcement, and we thoroughly doubt that the Vatican would be prepared to take any responsibility for an assertion by the <em>Echo de Paris</em>.

<p>Now as to what the assertion was about, which was contained in the aforementioned report by our Ambassador to the Vatican, it had in mind at all events the contemporary statement made by Pius X. The Pope grievously regretted not being able to prevent the war, for the only great power upon which he could count to obey him was Austria, and it was precisely Austria’s matter against Serbia that was only too just.  These words were spoken by Pius X in the presence of witnesses, whom we do not have authority today to name. They are not being published by us today for the first time, rather they were made available to the public shortly before Italy’s entrance into the war.

<p>The position that Pope Pius X took was in every regard irreproachable. It is also that Baron Ritter had “the Vatican take no such step,” since a private statement of the Pope is still not a diplomatic step of encouragement, least of all for a supposedly desired destruction of Serbia.

<p>It is precisely those familiar with the political ideas of Pius X who know that he let himself be deceived least of all by Serbia’s willingness to conclude a Concordat with the Holy See. Serbia sought the Concordat and it was obvious that the Vatican entered into it in the interest of defending the rights of the Church in so-called New Serbia. It was precisely the events in Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and so forth from the most recent rime, the persecution of Catholic priests, the attempt to bring about a schism by the Serbs, sufficiently evidences the Serbian-official disposition. Serbia needed, in its policy directed toward the establishment of a Greater Serbia Kingdom, an enticement for the Catholic southern Slavs of Slovenia and Croatia, who wanted nothing to do with an annexation to a schismatic neighboring country, in which up to a minute before the concluding of the Concordat the Church was worse off than in Russia. What great value the Serbian Government placed upon this treaty with the Pope, is shown by the fact, among other things, that Herr Pasitsch, in his flight from Nisch, took with him all other State treaties, but did not consider it worth the trouble to take along the original of the Concordat. It was taken there by the Austrians, given to the Vatican, and then by the Vatican later handed back to the Serbian Government in Corfu. Pius X knew no Pappenheimer. That might not be accepted conceptually by the <em>Echo de Paris</em>, but that changes nothing of the facts.

<p>So when <em>Stampa</em> and <em>Echo de Paris</em> go on with “the Serbian Embassy to the Holy See, which held fast to preserving the strictest neutrality from the first moment of diplomatic tension in July 1914, never thought of favoring one State to the disadvantage of the other,” this is senseless chatter, even apart from the fact that there is absolutely no Serbian Embassy to the Holy See.  The French correspondent perceived in the publication by Fechenbach and Eisner an effort to entangle the Pope in the politics of the Central Powers. But everyone knows that Eisner was pursuing an entirely different goal, and we have here a new proof that Eisner, with his disclosures, was shooting wildly and was completely incapable of appreciating even vaguely the import of his conduct.</blockquote>

<p> On September 18, 1848, in a revolutionary uprising in Frankfurt am Main, two representatives of the German National Assembly, Prince Lichnowsky and General von Auerswald, were massacred by a mob and their bodies mangled with beastly fury.  At the burial, Representative von Ketteler, later the famous Bishop of Mainz, gave the eulogy, closing with the following words:  

<p>“Now, however, a thought arises out of these graves and into my soul, which I must express in conclusion to you, my Christian brothers.  I see in the world, on the one hand, a powerful struggle and pressing and striving toward the highest ideals that the human soul is capable of, and on the other hand, I see the germination of such vile passions that have hardly ever been found in humanity; I hear the cry for universal peace – and whose soul doesn’t want to join in that with rejoicing – and I see people ever more divided, separated, riven, father from son, brother from sister, friend from friend; I hear the cry for equality among men, which the message of salvation has been speaking for millennia ...”

<p>Alongside that article on the front page:  “Führer?!” (A timely admonition by G.G.)

<blockquote>“I  paid my entire homage to my platoon commander”

<p>Thus goes the song of the old mercenaries, those rough fellows, who swore full allegiance to “their” leader and then to their platoon commander and to the banner he bore, or, as it says in another song, “give the lord everything, your big dead sword and your small living heart as well.”

<p>And these days? Certainly the romantic accompaniments of earlier recruiters have been replaced by much more prosaic manifestations, but here is an unmistakable fact that we must keep constantly in view: We now have an army of mercenaries, a recruited army of mercenaries, and with it the challenge of freeing ourselves from the mindset and nature of the previous “militarism” and of seeing the true nature of a troop of mercenaries, not through partisan lenses, nor under the influence of political voices of the moment. In this I am thinking not such much of the certainly considerable difficulties that stand in the way of being able to sweat it all out together as a unit and create “uniform” rather than just “uniformed” troops; furthermore I am also not thinking of the individual elements to be put in place or brought back into place; finally I am also not thinking of all the effort and attempts, experiments and methods that must be employed to take the conceived but not yet born “Reich Army” thing and bring it into the world, coddle it and tend it until the point in time when we can say: It runs and stands on strong legs! – whereby it must be taken into consideration that such a birth under the loving assistance of the Entente is certainly not going to occur without great labor pains. As stated, I do not underestimate the innumerable difficulties, and nonetheless I believe there is one point we must fundamentally and emphatically make clear, which does not appear at first glance to observers: that is the question of leaders! Not the question of who brings the group out of the gate, but rather the question: Can we, with these people, who have chosen their own leader, who have gone not to this or that unit, but rather to a particular “shouter in the squabble,” who have reported to a “man” like Märker, Lüttwitz, Lettow and whatever other name, I repeat, can we enlist these people with a stroke of the pen in whatever organization is set up by armchair planning and laying out details on a green table? The answer to that is a flat No. And that is simply by the nature of things.

<p>A larger, if not the largest part of the members of our strongest Freikorps units have, out of trust and respect, formed up around men from whom they hoped to find rescue and help for our tortured Fatherland, and have subordinated themselves often with great personal sacrifice. If one now separates for any reason – whether for unholy reason of State or “strategic” considerations – the soldiers and their leader, to whom they have pledged sword and heart, then the next time their enlistments run out there will be a frightful price to pay on a bill made without the proprietor. The days are gone when steady, well-formed regiments bound by centuries-old tradition could have a commanding officer assigned by royal order; we are now dealing with a bunch of individuals who have just one desire, one hope – which holds them together.

<p>It may be one of the hardest yet also most urgent tasks for the competent authorities to pay full attention to this question I have framed. How diverse the views are about this fundamental question was illuminated, as by a flash of lightning, by the “Reich Army Memorial Evening” on the Odeon Plaza.

<p>And now I come to the second and yet more important point: If we assume a case in which the students and reserve officers who are now available, go off somewhere else at the next end of enlistment period (and this case will large come to pass according to various previous indications), what then? One is not really going to object to me that for this case there all always new recruits from among the 7,000,000 German men who are trained soldiers, when we are only taking from them 100,000 men for the Reich Army. The objection is both correct and incorrect. Correct insofar as sufficient numbers will undoubtedly report, but incorrect in that a great proportion of those newly reporting will then mean fewer Reich Army troops. “We must set our second house upon reinforced concrete!” It does not serve the State and its responsible leaders at all if military service becomes the “refuge of scoundrels.” We need serious and complete men in these most difficult of all days. And so who comes actually into consideration for active service (after the departure of the above mentioned mercenaries!)? The farmer? Just go out into the countryside and listen with open ears!

<p>The worker? The hardworking, serious worker will only in the most extreme emergency exchange his lathe for a rifle!

<p>Thus we come to consider only the people who are without work, without occupation, as the main substitute. In no way do I want to maintain that this “substitute” is burdened with the same deficiencies as their war comrades. I am only getting a bearing on yet another new problem: There is, with reporting and recruiting, a close parallel to be made with supply and demand in commerce. I am now posing the possibility that in fact the supply of “soldiers” remains less than the demand for “Reich Army” (whereby it is to be considered that in my opinion only the best supplies are acceptable for the State), and I further posit the possible case that the competition for “worker services” absorbs the entire market and even pulls in the remaining numbers of “soldier”! Can’t such a “business boom” have really crisis-like consequences? Won’t this open the gates and doors to unlimited entry by those elements that have been trying every way up to now for force their way in, fortunately without appreciable success? What sort of powers are at work, what sort of unheard of efforts are being made against a strong State power, are best seen in the Appeal of the Communist Party (published in the <em>Allgemeine Rundschau</em> and in No. 145/146 of the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>). Thus the most urgent and well-grounded interests of State, together with consideration to be taken of every member of the Bavarian and German Freikorps, demand that the authorities who have influence in the selection of top leaders handle the matter of such appointments not just on the basis of old handed-down formalities, partisan politics and purely war-related evaluations. An officer can be well known as an outstanding strategist and yet be incapable as the head of a company! <strong>What we have and further indeed unconditionally need are leaders who are not only as officers, but also as men, are sincerely respected and loved by their subordinates!</strong>

<p>Editors’ Note: The question raised here has newly great significance indeed for Bavaria; that is to say, there currently exist differences of opinion between utilitarian and political circles about the question of appointments to leader positions, and the point of view raised by this contributor can have decisive significance for the resolving those differences.</blockquote>

<p>Does the Government believe that Munich Catholics and Munich Protestants will calmly accept such a violation of their freedom of conscience?  They too will demand the denominational school, just like their co-religionists in Berlin, and for the same reasons:

<p>1. Because the non-denominational school, as experience teaches us, merely means a step toward the religion-free school.

<p>2. Because the sacred right of the parents over the soul of their child must remain protected in a State that values freedom.

<blockquote>“A Coalition Cabinet Ministry Yet in Bavaria?”

<p>The <em>Bayerische Staatszeitung</em> writes from Bamberg:

<p>On the issue of the formation of the Bavarian Cabinet Ministry, it may now be said that the establishment of a coalition government is no longer out of the question. This was the desire not only of the currently governing party, but rather also of the other delegations, whose pressure thereby from outside was taken in account. Currently negotiations are pending among the delegations, since there are still some not inconsiderable difficulties to overcome. Still nothing more may change in the agreements in principle about the basic issues of establishing a coalition government, all the less since Bavaria is apparently required to accommodate itself to the other German States and also to the Reich with regard to the composition of the government. For weighty reasons in that regard, the Presidency of the Ministerial Cabinet is supposed to remain with the Social Democratic Party. Current Minister President Hoffmann will conduct the Presidency also in the future Coalition Ministry. On the whole the parties have achieved a united position about appointments to the individual departments, yet there are still negotiations pending with regard to appointments to several Ministries. Essentially, the individual Ministries are to be held in a similar manner to what was established in November 1918 before the outbreak of the revolution. Indeed several personalities named then are coming into consideration as members of the future Coalition Ministry. Difficulties still exist currently on account of appointments to the Military Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry, among other things. Initially some military persons were discussed also in Landtag Delegate circles, yet the appointment of a civilian minister is the most likely. There is talk among others of previous Military Minister Rosshaupter as the future director of the Military Department.

<p>We would not yet like to speak in such a specific form of the matter of the reorganization of the Cabinet Ministry, even if the likelihood of it is very great. In reality the negotiations are by no means finalized, and definitive matters are not yet specified. But one can certainly reckon on a change of personnel in the Ministry for Military Matters, after Major Paulus, whom Schneppenhorst wanted to make State Councilor there, is already no longer in active consideration. The destructive role that Major Paulus actually played for Bavaria will someday have to be the matter of close consideration.

<p>The delay in the declaration about the new organization of the Cabinet that was expected at the opening of the Landtag is explained also by the fact that the Government, like the party leaders, does not consider that point in time, namely the time of the Versailles Peace Treaty conditions, to be appropriate for taking up greater domestic alterations.

<p>Even though a clarification of the domestic political situation in Bavaria has not been accomplished up to now, there exists both in Government and in Landtag circles no doubt that the entire situation is pressing toward a revised formation of the Cabinet Ministry. The postponement of the debate over the interpellation concerning the Councils Republic in connection with general political statements was only held this Sunday on account of the Social Democratic State Party Congress, which will certainly bring a clarification in the situation of the Social Democratic Party. Thus one may expect a clarification of the overall situation next week.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Munich’s Devastation”

<p>In no. 331 of the <em>Kölner Volkszeitung</em> [Cologne People’s Newspaper], a Bavarian politician explored the reasons why Bavaria, the conservative agrarian region, had to experience more of Bolshevism than the other South German states. One cause that was brought up was the <em>Simplizissimus</em>-like iconoclasm, or Bohemianism, of Munich’s Schwabing district. Now Dr. Wolf-Kaiserslautern brings us an article entitled “Bavaria’s Political Devastation.”  We are reprinting the particularly political portion.  The more cultural portion, however, we do not wish really wish to withhold from our readers, even if we do not agree with each and every thing in it.  Thus it is not right that the work of Dr. Triller of the Catholic Press Association arrived “too late.”  It came late, very late, but nothing on this earth is ever too late if we are still alive, are working, and are able to make even great wrongs and omissions better.  With the “too late,” it is only too common to excuse inactivity in Munich.  It is always easier to criticize others complacently than to undertake positive action oneself.  That is true in Munich of 50 years ago as well as today...

<p>It appears exceptional in itself that this “Simplizissimus” spirit found precisely in Munich the rotten ground and perverted atmosphere that was necessary for it to flourish.  And yet it is not really surprising for those who look deeply into the situation in Munich.  The “upright, golden” Munich unsuspectingly and carelessly lives out the beer-besotted and sausage-scarfing existence of the Isar [River] Kapua.  Munichers were asleep and allowed foreigners to pull a fast one on them. Who conducted the main business in Munich during recent decades in every respect?  Foreign firms!  Munichers were content so long as they had their “fun” or “crowd festivities,” and whatever was foreign pleased them well enough just because it was foreign.

<p>Munichers observed with a certain Schadenfreude how the “artistic” people of Schwabing spilled their biting mockery upon everything, especially upon every authority, and nurtured by this poison the seeds of death for our entire public life...</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The New Formation of the Bavarian Cabinet Ministry”

<p><strong>The Social Democratic State Party Congress in Nuremberg approved, by a vote of 217 to 41, the motion of the Hoffmann Cabinet Ministry for the formation of a Coalition Ministry for Bavaria.</strong>

<p>Bavaria shall once again have a democratic government. A government that is lawfully set up by the representatives of the self-determining Bavarian people. A government that is responsible in all its measures to these representatives and to the entire electorate. A government that is conscious of its responsibility, its tasks within the framework of a democratic constitutional state, and its duties toward the people; a government that has the power and the courage to do right by these tasks and duties. A government that has the will to turn out with relentless energy the filth and slime that has accumulated in so many government positions. Not a Cabinet Government that in fateful decisions allows itself to be controlled by irresponsible advisors and assemblies, by influences from the streets and barracks. No a “government” that has its existence thanks to a mixture of democracy and uprising, and sees its most essential task in reach an “understanding” with the powers of high treason. Not a government of political suicide that wants to “cooperate” with the strangling of its own principles. No a government that lets itself be driven willy-nilly to the surrender of the prerequisites of its own existence. No, a government that not only “governs,” but also “rules” as the lawful organ implementing the will of the people.

<p>We have in Bavaria since November 7th – we can disregard for the moment the previous arrangements – had no such government. The first Cabinet Ministry that the revolution provided us laid the groundwork, by its military, constitutional and cultural policy, for the entire further development that found its conclusion in the military dictatorship of an Egelhofer. The leading personality of this Ministry, who throughout gave the entire conduct of the Cabinet its determining stamp despite isolated acts of resistance, pursued a policy that was every bit as incompatible with the will of the overwhelming majority of the Bavarian people as it was with the principles of democracy and the requirements of national economic life. What was sought to be accomplished by deliberate tactics and systematic initiatives, namely the constant and complete Bolshevization of Bavaria, the complete hollowing out of democracy, that was the result – for the most part unintentional – of the compromise policy of the second government. Reluctantly, yet not without intentionality, this Cabinet wore the iron chains of dependency upon the powers of Bolshevik revolution. And even as this dependency was removed by the events of April, one heard the clang of the chains dragging long on behind, and heard as well of efforts to put the torn-apart links back together anew.

<p>We perceive in the coming renewal and in the expansion of the Cabinet Ministry, the decision finally to be free of any such re-attachment to the traditions of revisionist Bolshevism. Indeed there can be no compromise here: either “dictatorship of the proletariat,” that is the dictatorship of a small number of pig-headed ideologues and misguided hangers-on, or parliamentary democracy and everything that goes with it. Any step away from the ground of the democratic constitutional state leads inevitably into the abyss.

<p>This ground of democracy is the common possession of all those who take seriously the fate of the people. In common also is the conviction about the major guidelines of appropriate policy: Provision of bread and work, establishment of ordered arrangements, social welfare by means of an impartial, farsighted policy for workers and the economy, restoration of the economic production that was almost completely crippled by the recent events, order in the extremely shaken state finances, re-establishment of the foundational principles of a purely public-oriented management of business.

<p>And because that is so, and because there is no difference of opinion among the parties either about the lawful constitutional foundations or about the concrete major tasks for future policy, that is why <strong>the issue of the new formation of the Government is less a party- than a personnel-question.</strong> Everyone who has strength and capability to work under the banner of the democratic program of reconstruction and domestic healing has today a claim upon the trust of the people. As least for so long as no irrefutable proofs are brought forward that this trust has been abused.</blockquote>

<p><strong>In the Landtag, the delegation of the Bavarian Volkspartei has introduced the following motions:

<p>On War Economy.</strong>

<p>The Chamber resolves to demand of the Government: 1. To give the Landtag an accounting of what remains of the Bavarian war provisions (meat, food, fodder, landestaat, hay and straw) and about the past and intended future use of these.  2. To give it a summary of what remains of the Bavarian Community resources during their individual fiscal years and to make an accounting of the use of any surpluses. 3. To present a businesslike, accurate accounting of the sale of army horses and army property. 4. To take care that the still available property of the army is justly distributed with particular consideration of artisans and trades. 5. To present the Landtag an accurate accounting of the amount of thievery of public property during the demobilization and of previous plundering and profiteering. 

<p>The Chamber resolves to demand that the Government to work with the Reich Government so that: 1. the existing and already dissolved war societies be thoroughly examined as to their business management and financial results; 2. Their surpluses be devoted to the general welfare; 3. prompt measures be taken to dissolve the still existing war societies or, to their extent their sudden dissolution is not possible for economic reasons, at least to scale them down.

<p><strong>Care for the war wounded.</strong>

<p>To demand with full emphasis that the Government provide: 1. that pensions for the war wounded, as well as for survivors of the fallen, and their other income, be timely increased in accordance with the current level of inflation; 2. that care for the war wounded be generously and uniformly organized and a representative for them be instituted to ensure implementation; 3. that those war wounded who are still capable of productivity – in order to avoid their isolation in warrior homes – be given back a productive economic life and supported thereby in every way, especially indeed by extension of credit; 4. that ...

<p><strong>On the issue of housing.</strong>

<p>With the urgent need that reigns in nearly all large cities and industrial cities to relieve the housing shortage and provide fitting and healthy dwellings free of defects, and especially to provide support to war participants and their families, and to be equitable for the dwelling needs of families with numerous children, the Government is requested ...

<blockquote>“On the Issue of the Coalition Government”

<p><strong>Bamberg,</strong> May 26. By informed sources it is reported to us: It is an idle game to try to name names today, when we know for certain that neither of the two non-Socialist parties has yet finally resolved the personnel issue. Some of the gentlemen that both parties have in mind have not yet declared their agreement. For various posts there has been no agreement reached as yet within the delegations, and it will probably be Wednesday or even early Thursday before all the decisions ar made in the area of personnel. In the meantime, the Minister President will have returned to Bamberg from an official trip to Berlin, so that the parliamentary implementation of the agreement can occur on Friday morning. It is a good assumption that the Minister President will place his office at the disposal of the Landtag. After the new election of the Minister President, with the assignment to form a Cabinet, the session will be adjourned for several hours. In the afternoon session, as soon as the Minister President is ready, he will introduce his new Ministers to the Landtag.

<p>The Bamberg Government organ <em>Der Freistaat</em> semi-officially summarizes its opinion about the issue of the Coalition Government as follows:

<p>“That the previous Socialist Government will now simply lower its sails, or that the Social Democratic Ministers will subordinate themselves to a bourgeois majority in the Cabinet Ministry, is something that no one believes. For then it would be much better to hand over to the bourgeois parties the entire work and the full responsibility. In that case, however, so much of the accomplishments of the revolution would be greatly endangered, and what form the constitution of the Free State of Bavaria could then take is not hard to guess. We take it that a way can be found for the appropriate influence upon matters of state can be assured to the Social Democratic Party and a liberal democratic policy in Bavaria can be absolutely guaranteed, without other parties being excluded from involvement and responsibility.”

<p>The organ of Munich Majority Socialism  expresses the following:

<p>“In the extreme need of our people, the Ministry has therefore decided to negotiate with the bourgeois parties about the formation of a Coalition Ministry, in which Social Democracy receives half of the Cabinet portfolios and the majority of votes, since it also holds the Minister Presidency. The Democrats would have the Justice and Commerce ministries at their disposal, and the Center Party the Finance and Agriculture ministries. Heinr. Frauendorfer would remain in office as Transportation Minister. The other ministries (Foreign Affairs, Interior, Education and Cultural Affairs, Social, and Military Affairs) fall to the Social Democracy.

<p>As the prerequisite for the concluding of an agreement along these lines, Gen. Hoffmann has demanded the establishment of a satisfactory working program for the new government, a minimal program to which the parties participating in the agreement must obligate themselves.”

<p>the <em>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</em> maintains that the following are at issue: for the Justice Ministry, Delegate Dr. Ernst Müller; for the Commerce Ministry, primarily Mayor Dr. Gessler, along with two well-known parliamentarians and State Councilor von Meinel.</blockquote>

<blockquote> “The Achilles Heel of the New Bavarian Constitution Outline”

<p>By Cathedral Deacon Dr. Kiefl, Regensburg

<p>However gratifying several ameliorations of the new outline appear compared to the original radicalism of the revolution, the most dangerous provision of the revolutionary program, the de-Christianization of the school, is still to be built into the new constitution, albeit in a more careful formulation. The fear that the Archbishop of Munich and Freising expressed in his New Year’s Eve sermon, that one is planning the separation of Church and State in Germany upon the French rather than the American model, would thus be fulfilled. We would be beginning in Bavaria with what the sad school legislation in France stopped with. If the constitution outline on the one hand completely assigns to the religious societies the imparting of religion instruction, when it still speaks on the other hand, however, of a religion instruction in governmental schools whose oversight by the Church would have to occur according to the orders of the State, then the intention of the outline is clear. The small and substantively completely meaningless provision that times in the school day and perhaps also venues are made available for religion instruction – which to an extent is also the case in France – is to be sold out to the weighty rights of the State to intervene in the Church’s oversight right. Now there is absolutely no indication that according to the previous constitution, the oversight right of the Church over religious and moral doctrine and over the religious-moral life in the teaching- and educational institutions was guaranteed. The pertinent point is rather the following: The Christian religion is removed from the organic curriculum of the school as expressed unreservedly, without regard to the developments of a thousand years, by the governmental school monopoly. That is exactly the French school program, which the French Church, in a life and death struggle, overturned. The governmental school monopoly would then become for us too, as insightful leaders of Catholicism in France rightly predicted, the surest instrument for the spiritual enslavement of peoples...</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The New Formation of the Government”

<p>by Dr. Georg Heim

<p>The motion of the Hoffmann Ministry for the formation of a Coalition Ministry has been accepted by the Social Democratic State Party Congress. The present Government has itself the greatest interest in the coming into being of a Coalition Ministry. The fundamental principles of democracy know only one government, that which is supported by a majority of the people’s representatives. Our south German neighbor states Württemburg and Baden, which held fast to this democratic principle from the first day of the revolution, remained protected from all the evil and enormous harm that arose in Bavaria. For any Bavarian who visits Württemburg and Baden, the powerful difference between there and here must make an immediate impression on the eyes. It is enough just to compare the state of transportation... How much harm would have been avoided in Bavaria if the foundational principles of honorable democracy had been maintained here as there.

<p>The sooner the U-turn succeeds the better. For this reason the Hoffmann Ministry is to be thanked for finally now putting things on the line, by which alone can improvement arise. But if a Coalition Minsitry is to be created, then this Coalition Minsitry must be put together according to true democratic and parliamentary principles ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The New Coalition Ministry and Its Program”

<p><strong>Bamberg,</strong> May 31 (our own telegraphic 
report)
<p><strong>The New Cabinet Ministry</strong>

<p>is seated as follows:

<p>President and Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs: <strong>Hoffmann</strong>

<p>Interior: <strong>Segitz</strong>

<p>Foreign Affairs: Provisionally <strong>Ackermann</strong>

<p><strong>In the State Councils …</strong>

<p><strong>Agreements of the Bavarian Volkspartei, the Bavarian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic party for the formation of a new Government in Bavaria</strong>

<p>The overly harsh, cruel peace terms of the Entente threaten our German and Bavarian people in their very existence. Any hope of preventing complete economic and moral collapse and the social destitution of our people resides only in the strong solidarity and joint effort of the entire people. This desperate situation of our State and the extreme need of our people thus requires the undersigned parties to form a joint Government under the following prerequisites.

<p>A) <strong>Prerequisites:</strong>

<p>The new Government has the mission to bring order in the economic and political situation of the state and to restore regular parliamentary life. In particular, the ordering of the completely ruined State finances is to be regarded as the joint task of all the parties. For that reason the necessary deeps cuts in all programs that are necessary for the salvaging of our finances will apply expressly to the entire Government including the parties represented in the Government.

<p>All arrangements upon which the formation of the pre-existing government rested are rendered null and void by the current agreement. The Enabling Act of March 18, 1919 is invalidated, it programmatic content is superseded by the present agreements.

<p>The parties that are forming the new Government obligate themselves and their Landtag delegations to the implementation of the following <strong>Program:</strong>

<p>B) <strong>Political Agreements.

<blockquote>I. Economic and Social Policy.</blockquote>

<p>1. Socialized Economy</strong>

<p>a) the mining activities within the territory of the Bavarian State and the water works that serve the production of electric power are to be taken into the common economy. The further construction of water power is to be accomplished most rapidly. Appropriate measures for the systematic influence and control of food, dwellings and clothing are to be accomplished, and the interests of the common good are to be defended against efforts of exploitation.

<p>b) the general transfer of pharmacies into the common economy is to be prepared as soon as possible.

<p><strong>2. Social measures and care for the war wounded.</strong>
<p>...

<blockquote>II. Constitution and Cultural Policy.</blockquote>

<p>The following specifications are agreed as basic features for the future constitution:

<p><blockquote><strong>I. Constitutional Policy.</strong></blockquote>

<p>a) Bavaria is a Free State and as such a member of the German Reich.

<p>b)  the supreme authority of the Bavarian State resides in the people.

<p>c) Every resident of the Bavarian State who has completed the 20th year of life is a State Citizen, without distinction of birth, gender, religion or occupation.

<p>d) Through election by the State Citizens the Landtag is formed, which consists of one Chamber. The vote is universal, equal, direct, secret, and proportional in the representational results.

<p>e) The State assures the inviolability of the person and freedom of opinion verbally and written. Freedom of art and science is guaranteed; restrictions can be made only by law by reason of preservation of public order, security and morals.

<p>f)  Property is inviolable; expropriation of property can only be done for the common good and by act of law.

<p>g) All privileges of birth, nobility as well as titles, which are not occupational designations, are abolished. Rights of entail may no longer be established.

<p>h) The Communities and Community Groupings have the right of self-government subjet to provision of law. Elections to Community representative bodies shall have results according to the same principles as the Landtag elections.

<p>i) The parties and their delegations expressly obligate themselves to prepare expeditiously the final version of the State Constitution.

<p>k) Amendments to the future Constitution can only be decided by two-thirds vote of the Landtag.

<blockquote><strong>II. Cultural Policy.</strong></blockquote>

<p>a) Full freedom of religion and conscience, and their exercise, is guaranteed.

<p>b) No teacher may be compelled by the State in relation to imparting religion instruction or participation in Church activities. No student may be compelled to attend religion instruction or participate in Church activities and ceremonies against the convictions of parents and guardians. Excusal from religion instruction is accomplished by the parents and guardians verbally or in writing to the school board and the pastor. Freeing of a student from religion instruction is completely accomplished by the simple excusal request. A parent or guardian need give no one an explanation of the reasons for his decision. From the completion of the 16th year of life onward, the student has the right of self-determination about participation in religion instruction and Church activities.

<p>c) No one may be induced by governmental compulsion to entry into a religious society, to participation in worship, to remaining in a religious society, or to leaving one.  No one may, without prejudice to church discipline, be subjected to any kind of punishment or other disadvantage on account of his religion.

<p>d) All religious societies are free in their religious activity, they enjoy the same rights and the same protection from the State. Property rights of religious societies and existing obligations of the State toward them can only be dissolved by means of law.

<p>e) The imparting of curricular religion instruction is incumbent upon the religious societies. In the event there should be separation of Church and State and nothing else is prescribed by the Reich Constitution, then the principles recognized in the April 2, 1919 session of the Weimar Constitution Committee by their acceptance of Article 30a of the Constitution will apply for Bavaria as well.

<p>g) [sic: no subsection (f) in the original] The regulation of the school oversight issue will be finalized forthwith by a decree from the Education Ministry along the lines of the previous provisional decree.

<p>h) The transformation of existing denominational schools into inter-denominational schools or the new establishment of inter-denominational schools may not occur against the express established majority will of the parents and guardians whose children at the time of the referendum are of school age.

<p>In cities with more than 20,000 residents and with a well- ordered school system is at hand, the referendum results will provide the basis for the proportional allocation of denominational and inter-denominational schools.

<blockquote><strong>C. Peace Issues.</blockquote>

<p>The concluding of a separate peace with the Entente is ruled out.

<blockquote>Composition of the new Government.</strong></blockquote>

<p>1. Of the ten Cabinet Ministries, the Social Democrats occupy five along with the Presidency; the Bavarian Volkspartei two (Finance and Agriculture), the German Democratic Party two (Justice and Commerce), and the Transportation Ministry remains under its current leadership. The Bavarian Volkspartei receives four State Councilor positions (Transportation, Interior, Social Ministry, Commerce). The Bavarian Farmers League receives one State Councilor position each in the Agriculture Ministry and in the Forest Management Division of the Finance Ministry.

<p>2. State Councilor positions that are coming into service by reason of the agreement of the parties are political offices with no claim for maintenance upon appeal and counter-appeal. If they are bureaucrats, then they will be granted leave of absence with protection of their positions and rights.

<blockquote><strong>E. Concluding Remarks.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing agreements have binding effect for the participating parties so long as they participate on that basis in the Government that is now being formed.

<p>Parliamentary democracy knows of two main forms of Coalition Cabinet Ministry, one of them when the Coalition is prescribed by law, the other when it is grounded merely on practical fact. In a Coalition Ministry  prescribed by law, as for instance was recommended by the authors of one of the outlines of the Baden Constitution (otherwise without effect) based on the Swiss model, the parties, by virtue of a provision of law, are represented according to their numerical strength; but here the policy for this Government rests necessarily and continually upon a compromise among the demands of the programs of the Coalition parties. The Coalition Ministry founded on this practical fact has for its presupposition that a single party has neither the material nor the moral power for generally taking on the affairs of Government and the responsibility that goes with them...

<p>In a political constellation that received its defining characteristics through a revolution and indeed through a revolution originating in the Socialist working class, it is obvious that the Majority Socialist Party is called to play a role out of proportion to the purely numerical portion of votes it received. This is doubly obvious when it concerns a Party whose program belongs equally to the two developmental phases, the phase of revolutionary uprising and the phase of democratic consolidation. This situation changes, however, as soon as there is a clarification of the revolutionary problems. Once it becomes the case that one such party is too weak, because of foreign or domestic reasons, to run the Government by itself, then it faces the choice of seeking support and alliance either on the left from the revolutionary side, or on the right from the democratic side. What results then is either the policy of Socialist popular front with a coalition of Majority Socialists – Independent Socialists – Communists, or the policy of the democratic coalition that has indeed materialized in the rest of the Reich.  If the former comes to pass, then the democratic component of the Majority Socialist Party is completely abandoned without restriction; if the latter comes to pass, then it is necessary initially to put the fully Socialist goals on the back burner. A third course is not possible, because it is self-evident that the parties being drawn into the Coalition will make their cooperation and continuance in the Coalition dependent upon the Coalition’s clear commitment, whether to the revolutionary principle or the democratic principle of the Coalition.

<p>The claim of the Majority Socialist Party to receive a privileged position in the case of a democratic coalition by virtue of the right of revolution (and indeed by virtue of the right not of the past but rather of a future revolution), would be every bit as unjustifiable as the claim, in the case of a revolutionary coalition, to enjoy a privileged position by virtue of parliamentary right. In both cases it is a matter of applying measures that only have sense and meaning by reason of other presuppositions.

<p>If the non-Socialist parties are thus entering the Government at the present moment and thereby assuming responsibility for a political and economic development whose principles were essentially created by the revolution, if they are resolved to share in bearing the consequences of events that occurred without their will and against their will, if they are taking these obligations upon themselves especially in fields where the results of the revolution are most conspicuous, then this discharge of the previous powers that be – such at least is the conviction of the dominant portion of our people – must go along with the unconditional guaranteeing of the democratic program. Were it not so, then the resulting new disappointment would be very hard to overcome.

<p>Upon this unconditional duty to make clear the alternatives, no influence can be allowed for considerations of a partisan tactical nature, nor for difficulties that arise from this or that decision. If such considerations were to play any role significant enough to upset the principle upon which the Coalition rests, that would undo the prerequisites of the Coalition itself. A certain measure of consideration for the internal situation of one of the parties in the Coalition is therefore possible only insofar as the foundation of the Coalition itself is not shaken thereby...

<p>Since the second summoning of the Landtag on March 17th and the acceptance of the provisional constitution, the Bavarian people have had – or should have had – a parliamentary regime. If parliamentarism were now to incline toward deepening the division between the people, who “are only sovereign on election day,” and the parliament that is in full possession of power, that would greatly worsen the division previously created by the course of events including the revolutionary developments and the temporarily successful exclusion of the Landtag. Without reversing the undoubtedly existing division, the establishing of the Coalition Ministry cannot last. In what manner this reversing takes shape depends upon the particular form of the newly established Ministry. To close up this division, to re-establish what should be a natural harmony between the voters on the one hand and the views and measures of the Landtag and Government on the other hand, is the first task for all responsible authorities.</blockquote>

<p>Our entire national German wealth, thus the wealth of all the rich bankers and Jews, like Bleichröder, Rothschild, Mendelsohn and so forth, who alone possess 60,000 million Marks, the wealth of all the industries, trades and farmers, landowners and small rentiers, the property of the Reich, the States and the entities operating railroads, gas works, etc., thus our entire national wealth, was valued during peacetime by some at 350 billion, by others at 400 billion...

<p>... Communism is only possible if each sacrifices for the others... whether a Rothschild, a Bleichröder, or a Mendelsohn will voluntarily share his entire wealth up to 700 Marks to each, without intending to get back all his money with full interest, I leave to the consideration of reasonable thinking people.  Also Eisner, Wadler, Mühsam, Fechenbach, Toller, Jacobi, Landauer, Levien, Levine etc. have gotten nothing from their racial brethren Rothschild, Bleichröder etc., and there would not be anything to be gotten from them anyway.

<p>In view of this thoroughly satisfactory balance of work in the hotly contested forum of the National Assembly, there may and should, however, be an acknowledgement on the other hand that the worm of discord and disunity is gnawing at the roots of the Catholic organizations, in whose political work some low-down pastors are participating. Certain impudent elements are proceeding to promote a liberal democratization of the political activity of Catholics. They have set forth an extremely radical program and think it is their mission to loosen the fetters of the clerical class in the sense of a modern socialization of it. These gentlemen mean well, to be sure, but they overlook the higher principles that absolutely stand in the way of such a “reform” that would overthrow the order and discipline of the Church.</blockquote>

<a name="14d"></a><p><strong>June 7, 1919</strong> <em>Münchener Beobachter</em>, pp. 1-2:

<blockquote>“Can a Catholic Be an Antisemite?” by “Rhenus”

<p>A question that is unfortunately very much of the moment is being discussed by quite many in view of the current agitation of spirits.

<p>This same question had already become a burning issue in Bavaria about 30 years ago when the Pastor and <em>Landtag</em> representative Dr. Friedrich Frank, in a brochure published by G.J. Manz in Regensburg, entitled “The Church and the Jews,” thought the question must be answered with an emphatic “No!”

<p>Obviously this “No!” is only Herr Dr. Frank’s personal view, which cannot be supported by any pronouncement of the supreme Magisterium.  

<p>I maintain that a good Catholic, a believing Christian, can be of a completely different view from that pastor concerning antisemitism.

<p>Many pious Catholics of previous and present times have made a name for themselves as they were, if not in name, at least in deed, antisemites.

<p>A whole series of Bishops and Popes can be called out by name, who were and are adversaries of the Jews.

<p>Granted, a Catholic can never be or become an antisemite if antisemitism stands in contradiction with Catholic doctrine or with Christian moral law.

<p>Demonstrating such a contradiction, however, is beyond the capacity of even the most learned theologians.

<p>Indeed the aforementioned Pastor Dr. Frank knew of no positive Church proclamation to present in relation to the above question, and therefore I consider it a wrongheaded game to scare the Christian people away from antisemitism on supposed religious-moral grounds.  The solution of the Jewish question will only be obstructed by such hair-splitting, and the solution of the social question will only be delayed, for the “social question is essentially the Jewish question,” in the winged words of Otto Glagaus.

<p>Now what do the antisemites want?

<p>“Antisemites want to combat, by means of law, without touching upon the Jewish faith, the overly powerful harmful influence of Jews upon all spheres of public life.”

<p>In their eyes the Jews are a foreign nation, a state within a state, an exceptional community that lives at the expense of other peoples.

<p>Antisemites, in their writings, want to enlighten the German <em>Volk</em> about the dangerousness of Jewish influence, combat the corruption of the Jewish press, support the Christian German press, summon to life associations to defend rights against Jewish encroachments, and elect antisemitic-minded <em>Volk</em>-representatives.

<p>Every upright German adult, whatever confession or political party to which he may adhere, can become a member of this alliance. 

<p>So the question is posed:  can a Christian, a faithful Catholic, be an antisemite on the basis of this program?

<p>Jew-lackeys and Jew-descendants,* granted, are of the opinion that a Catholic may not be an antisemite.

<p>[Footnote *: The “German-Social” newspapers and “Das Bayerische Vaterland” reported that Dr. Frank was a baptized Jew.]

<p>Since the emancipation of the Jews, an idea for which we have the French Revolution to thank, and which was introduced after the Revolution of 1848 generally in all European countries, the Christian people in all countries that are blessed with Jews have gone into visible decline, while the wealth and influence of the Jews have continually grown in all spheres of public life.  Many insightful men have warned against this pap of equal-rights-endowed citizens.  Jews were the hereditary tenants of this new wisdom and exploited it to their advantage. All social bonds were dissolved, only the great Jewish league remained naturally in existence.  The Jews were thus emancipated and received constitutionally the same political rights as the native population.

<p>The emancipation of the Jews brought to term some really tragic fruit for the <em>Volk</em>.  The reason lay right in the ignorance or at least the limited knowledge of the essence of Talmudic Jewry.  They intended to raise the Jews to their level, they hoped that they would be, if not indeed assimilated with the native population, at least conscious of being endowed with the same rights and duties as they.  Against that, however, stood and stands the unalterable doctrine of the Talmud, by which Jewry stands and falls.  The fundamental doctrine that the Jewish people are the chosen people, that the world belongs to the Jews by right, that Christians, as idolaters, are far below Jews and really not even to be considered as humans but rather as “the seed of beasts.”  The actual comparative evaluation of Jews with Christians was, under the Talmud doctrine, unchangeable because based on the divine pronouncements of the Rabbis, that only Jews were the fellow man of Jews, whereby the entire Decalog, which is yet the foundation of every type of state, received a reinterpretation overwhelmingly favorable to the Jews.  Thus the Christians were disadvantaged from the outset vis-à-vis the Jews, since they were obliged to consider the Jews as their fellow man as a matter of religious viewpoint, while the Jew, however, according to the doctrine of the Talmud, was relieved of all obligations of love for neighbor toward the Christians, and if he carried them out, it was only for the sake of peace, or in order to avoid coming into conflict with punitive laws.  The trustful souls of the Christians thus really held out hope, in their enthusiasm, that with the nice idea of equality and brotherhood, which in their nature was really Christian, the Jews would become set free from their ethnic national religious worldview if the same political rights were shared with them, and would take up a Christian standpoint, and for their part, would consider the Christians as their equals!

<p>That actually meant expecting the Jews to give up the Talmud or give it a “Christian” reinterpretation; that was too much to expect.  That is something the Talmud-Jews could not and cannot do, so long as they want to remain Jews.

<p>Therein lay the fateful error.  The emancipation of the Jews was thus a great political mistake which severely harmed the Christian people and which can be made good again only with great difficulty if at all.

<p>If the emancipation of the Jews had benefited the native population in the spheres of economics or politics, or if it had not harmed them, then antisemitism would not have arisen and would not be justified.

<p>But practical experience since the emancipation of the Jews teaches that the Jews, apart from notable exceptions, do not want to live on the same footing as us, but to live off of us, off the work of the producing classes.  

<p>Antisemites want – equally because they are convinced of the incompatibility of the Jewish and the Christian worldviews; because they perceive that the Jews, so long as they hold fast to their Talmud, despite naturalization, will still be and remain a foreign nation that will never assimilate with the native population; because they perceive that the Talmud, which is and remains an unalterable divine law book for the Jews, allows the peaceful coexistence of Talmud-Jews with Christians on the basis of equal civil rights only with the greatest harms to the Christian people – to restrict the civil rights of the Jews by means of law, without prejudice to universal natural law.

<p>Public offices should not be held open to Jews without discrimination; no Jew should act as judge over Christians, no Jewish teacher should instruct and form Christian children.  Stricter usury laws should be enacted, the harmful influence of the Jewish press should be broken, the reign of interest-yielding big capital should be broken and its assets applied to public uses in extensive ways.

<p>This is not about rabble-rousing against Jews, but about defense of the native Christian <em>Volk</em>. This is necessary for the urgent struggle of the Christian German <em>Volk</em> for its future, for its economic and moral well-being. 

<p>And that is supposed to be un-Christian? Then we would have to accuse our Christian forefathers of lack of Christian sense as they learned to know the Jews through long interaction and refused them equal political rights, and even the Catholic Church, which called such un-Christian conduct good and did not protect against it, would have to be denounced as un-Christian.

<p>Or is this unjust? To defend oneself and the Christian <em>Volk</em> by means of law from assault by Talmudic Jewry can certain not be an injustice, it is the right of self-defense.

<p>Every people has the right to be established in its own country according to its own needs.

<p>But is this not reactionary with respect to modern principles of liberty, equality and fraternity?  If one is standing before an abyss, going forward is obviously nonsense and insanity; stepping back is the only solution.

<p>Or is it against the constitution?  Perhaps.  But the constitution is not immutable like the Talmud; it is not divine law.  It can be amended in a lawful way and must be amended if the well-being of the <em>Volk</em> requires it.  And for our Christian <em>Volk</em> and also for the Catholic Church, an amendment of the constitution in the indicated direction can bring no disadvantage, but only great advantage.

<p>It is becoming ever clearer to us that the Christian state capitulated to Jewry in the revolutionary era. It gave up its Christian character and declared itself non-confessional, merely to be able to satisfy the Jews.  Since then everything, even the highest state offices, are constitutionally open to the Jews.

<p>I ask now: The believing Christian, the Catholic, should not be allowed to be an antisemite under these circumstances?  What then?  Perhaps a philo-semite?  Or should Catholics look on passively at this justified struggle for the well-being of the Christian <em>Volk</em>, leaving it to the other Christian confessions and thereby playing the role of cheap critic as a neutral observer?  No, in this essential struggle no Christian who is honorably minded toward his <em>Volk</em> and his religion can remain indifferent. 

<p>Here it is a matter of deciding for or against the Christian <em>Volk</em>.

<p>Perhaps Christian love forbids the Catholic Christian to be an antisemite?

<p>Christianity forbids in all events personal hatred and excesses of all sorts.  But Jew-hatred and violence against the Jews are absolutely no essential part of antisemitism.

<p>To hate error and wrongs, to expose error and do away with wrongs and crimes, neither Christianity nor reason forbid it, rather they imperatively demand it.

<p>But the attitude of Popes and Bishops of the Catholic Church, doesn’t that have to scare off Catholics from antisemitism?

<p>It is true, Popes and Bishops have, at times of rabble-rousing against Jews, sought to defend the Jews against excesses and violence; they have forbidden forced conversion. In that, I think, every antisemite, every friend of humanity, will find right. 

<p>If moreover individual Popes did not want to believe in Jewish ritual murder, then that was their personal view; they certainly did not know the Talmud and the secret doctrine of the Jews, and thus held such cruel crimes to be impossible.  That does honor to their humanitarianism.

<p>They also may have not wanted to provoke the nonetheless high-rising agitation of the Christian <em>Volk</em> by opposite statements, wanting instead to calm the unleashed wrath of the <em>Volk</em>; certainly a noble intention.  Yet this too was only their personal view and not an official doctrinal decision; this followed from the previous fact that other Popes had approved or at least allowed the honoring of children murdered by the Jews, as martyrs.  Further than that, however, the defense given by Popes and Bishops of the Catholic Church to the persecuted Jews did not extend.  On the contrary, they showed themselves in many cases to be real antisemites.

<p>Thus Pope Gregory VII, the greatest man of his century, wrote an earnest admonition to King Alfonso of Castile that "he might not allow his Christian subjects to be oppressed by the Jews."  And Archbishop Bernhard of Toledo asked the King that “he might yet give to the Jews none of the Christian-oppressing privileges.”  Against princely patrons of the Jews, Bishops and Synods often stepped up.  

<p>Pope Innocent indeed forbade forcing Jews to adopt Christianity, but he also ordered them to be kept within necessary bounds; they should not be public officials and may not take usurious interest.  (Do antisemites want anything different from this Pope?)

<p>Pope Pius IX strictly implemented in Rome the old Church law that Christians may not be serving maids for Jews. Was that not antisemitic?

<p>Pope Leo III [sic: Leo XIII], when he was still Bishop of Perugia, sought to protect Christians from usurious exploitation on the part of the Jews, by re-establishing a lending bank.  Thus he showed himself to be a “practical antisemite,” if one may call the matter by its right name. And isn’t his glorious encyclical on the social question not primarily directed, at its core, against the abuse and excessive power of big capital, which is overwhelmingly in Jewish hands?  The theory is still coming into practice.

<p>So can a believing Christian be an antisemite? I answer that question with complete conviction, and I hope the esteemed reader will agree with me: “Yes.”

<p>A believing Christian may be an antisemite; nothing prevents him from it, not his Christian faith, not the love of neighbor that Christianity requires of him; on the contrary: The love of Christianity and of his Church, the love of his <em>Volk</em> that is oppressed by Jewry, imperiously demands of the Catholic that he associate himself with those who have taken up the struggle against overly powerful Jewry.

<p>Yes, the believing Christian may and should close ranks fully and completely with the Christian-Social antisemites; it is his duty in view of the danger that grows from day to day toward the Christian <em>Volk</em>.</blockquote><br>

<p>In the Bavarian press reaching me today I have read the agreements concluded among the parties that have entered to participate in the new coalition Cabinet in Bavaria, and naturally my attention is drawn in a special way to the part concerning the so-called culture policy. Even taking account of the extraordinary difficulties of the present hour, I confess nonetheless to Your Most Reverend Excellency that I noticed not without surprise how the Catholics of the Bavarian People’s Party had yielded without ado on most important points that not only have already been the object of public demonstrations by the Bavarian Bishops (and particularly by Your Excellency) but also touch upon the Concordat.

<p>Before thus reporting to the Holy See, as is obligatory in view of the serious issue, I would be grateful to Your Excellency if you would in your exquisite goodness and exalted intelligence, which I have always appreciated, furnish me news in this regard, indicating to me especially how, why, and by what authority the Bavarian People’s Party thought it could enter into agreements which (if I have understood correctly) at least partially indeed contradict provisions of the Concordat, and what compensatory guarantees it has obtained, on the other hand, for the future of the Catholic Church.

<a name="15b"></a><p><strong>June 13, 1919</strong> Faulhaber in Munich to Pacelli in Rorschach, Switzerland:

<blockquote>Your Excellency!

<p>Most Reverend Lord Apostolic Nuncio!

<p>Just yesterday, as I was receiving the most treasured letter from Your Excellency, it became possible for me for the first time to ask a member of the Bavarian People’s Party, the priest and professor Dr. Eggersdorfer of Passau, about the agreements among the political parties participating in the new Ministerial Cabinet. Thus it came out that the publication of the new Government’s program in the press, for example the “Bavarian Staatszeitung” no. 138 of June 1st, did not completely and accurately convey the official text of the program, which naturally makes it more difficult for us to step up against this program, as the decisive sentences about the culture-political future in Bavaria are not characterized with any kind of stylistic and logical clarity, much less statesmanlike insight. The most frightful sentence, which stands at the head of the Government program in the Staatszeitung: “The parties obligate themselves and their delegations in the Landtag to the implementation of the following program,” is not taken by Dr. Eggersdorfer as though the case is now already closed as to these agreements and modifications in the official deliberations in the Landtag are cut off in advance. He repeatedly maintained in any event that on account of transportation difficulties, plenary meetings of the Bavarian People’s Party have been extraordinarily difficult and that Minister Hoffmann has negotiated much with individual members of the party.

<p>About the genesis of the agreements that have frightfully surprised and alarmed us Catholics in Bavaria, he says: About three weeks ago, Minister Hoffmann had the leaders of the Bavarian People’s Party and the German Democratic Party come to him and declared to them: either both these parties join in the Government or the Social Democrats will resign from the Government and leave Bavaria to Bolshevism.  In order to protect the State from the return of the reign of terror of the Räterepublik, both the parties declared themselves ready to cooperate. In the negotiations, the representatives of the Bavarian People’s Party were apparently more mindful of the even more radical provisions of the previous constitution outline than of Catholic principles, and kept seeking only to moderate the much more radical provisions  by way of compromise, for example they were apparently happy that section 15 of the State fundamental law (“religious societies order and administer their affairs independently in accordance with State laws”) is no longer carried over into the new program, but for other equally unecclesiastical stipulations they had less of a sharp eye.

<p>Also the 16th birthday as the age of majority for religious matters was a compromise between the 14th and the 18th year. Moreover the responsible officers of the Bavarian People’s Party only read what was in the Government program, without paying attention to what was not in it, for example the Church’s right of taxing its own members, the right of schools run by religious orders. It would not be difficult at the moment to stop trusting the Bavarian People’s Party, but it would be very difficult to set up a new political organization of Bavarian Catholics in its place. Of any sort of quiet effort to secure the rights of the Church, I could learn nothing from Dr. Eggersdorfer.

<p>I have now written, in the presence of my Diocesan Ordinariate, the following for Dr. Eggerdorfer to share about my standpoint to the People’s Party, in this way:

<p>1. I do not underestimate the extraordinary difficulties of the present hour, especially not the danger of a new revolution, and I do not doubt the good intentions of the leaders of the People’s Party. There are, however, certain limits to compromises in religious-political questions, where inalienable principles and rights of the Church are at stake, and where the Government program of a Kulturkampf-inclined Minister cannot be accepted lock, stock and barrel at any price, even the price of Cabinet positions and other advantages. In particular, partisan political questions, such as how many Cabinet ministers and State councilors will be appointed from a party, may not be mixed with culture-political questions that substantially contradict the laws of the Church, the proclamations of the Bishops and the will of the Catholic people. It is one thing if the party is represented in an already existing coalition Cabinet and in realpolitik accommodates a lesser evil under protest, but it is something else if the party, before entering into a Government, obligates itself to the implementation of a program that is not compatible with Church law.

<p>2. Hoffmann’s school decree of January 25th, which institutes a right of parents and guardians to take their children out of religious education, is, despite all protests of the Catholic people, not only continued in the new Government program, but even aggravated insofar as students 16 years and older can keep out of religious instruction by their own preference without any inquiry to the parents. Before the elections [of January 12, 1919], the People’s Party publicly demanded the confessional school and assurances of Catholic education, and now it has agreed to establish inter-denominational schools upon the request of a majority of parents [in a town or school district]. The trust of the Catholic people in the People’s Party must be heavily shaken by this, which will be shown in the next elections. The yieldingness of individual party members as to school policy is all the less understandable, as the Bishops previously sent every delegate the ecclesiastical guidelines for the school question in a memorandum that I approved for distribution. 

<p>3. Of all questions, the question of the confessional school is the most important, in order to bring in a general popular agreement in the so-called referendum. And if the confessional school is not established as the normal school, then we demand just as in Belgium in 1879, the free school, for which, however, only simple school taxes must be paid.  Above all, the rights of parents in the school issue must be advocated as strongly as possible.

<p>4. The next matter to be handled in the Landtag is the teacher law and the school finance law, where again in Article 76 Section 2 the school finance law of 1902 and with it the confessional school are disempowered. The People’s Party must above all put the question before the Bavarian people whether then the school policy of the day in Bavaria is going to be really the most urgent matter, or whether concerns for peace and the economy, for bread and work, might be more pressing than the implementation of the Government program of a Minister who coincidentally feels himself expert only in the field of education.

<p>It is certainly in connection with this conduct of the Government, that the Holy Father has reservations about conferring upon the Government the indult for the right of presentation of parishes to new pastors. Among the ranks of the clergy, frankly the long vacancies are more painfully felt the longer they continue.

<p>The great public Corpus Christi procession unfortunately cannot take place this year in Munich...

<p>Yesterday in the Benedictine church of St. Boniface was the election of the new abbot here, former Prior Fr. Bonifaz Wöhrmüller...

<p>With the wish that the Nunciature may be preserved for us in Bavaria, and the effectiveness of Your Excellency may be accompanied by the same rich blessing in the future as before, and with the expression of my deepest respect, I remain ... </blockquote><br>


<a name="15ba"></a><p><strong>June 13, 1919</strong> Eggersdorfer to Faulhaber:

<blockquote>Your Excellency, Most Reverend Herr Archbishop!

<p>May I be allowed to make the following expansion upon the report and remarks you allowed me to make the day before yesterday:

<p>The suggestion that, as a corrective to the early age of religion-deciding maturity, the confirmation age might be pushed back and a more extensive instruction given for making such decision, in no way arose from the [BVP’s Landtag] delegation. There it was only agreed whether the negotiations should collapse over the issue of 16 years as the decisive age. My motion that they should was outvoted by 23 votes against versus 18 in favor. The suggestion of raising the confirmation age and providing more decisional instruction arose from a conference with the clergy of the city of Passau, which I held concerning these issues...

<p>In the matter of the inter-denominational school, may I state clearly that the text of the agreement says:

<p>“The transformation of existing confessional schools into inter-denominational schools or the new establishment of inter-denominational schools ...

<p>Thus the inter-denominational school is not expressly made the norm. Rather it is presupposed that when the parents register their children at the beginning of the year, they will at the same time register whether they want the confessional or the inter-denominational school. Such preferences shall be registered not annually, but rather upon demand from time to time.  That still appears to me to be the best we can achieve under the circumstances of the current majority. The state of the law up to now is worse. According to it, the entirety of the Munich schools could have been turned into inter-denominational ones at the beginning of the new school year, because up to now only the decision of the school authorities and the approval of the Government was necessary. The transformation would have certainly occurred, if I am correctly informed.

<p>In the meantime a new act of the Hoffmannisch school battle appears to be at hand. Of the three monastic institutions for teacher training in Lower Bavaria, two have received a prohibition on taking in new students for 1919/20 (Seligenthal and Ursulinen-Straubing). The third, Freudenhaim-Passau, may only take 10 instead of 12. What is happening here with Upper Bavaria?

<p>I sent Speck a quick copy of this instruction together with an outline of my discussion with Your Excellency, in order perhaps to bring about an early occasion to further dissolve the connection to Hoffmann.

<p>Might I again present Your Excellency a copy of the resolutions of June 10th, with the devoted request that you examine closely whether they are basically on the right path. As soon as possible I will send Your Excellency an exemplar of the constitution outline. Then the recommended formulations shall be immediately sought.

<p>Your Archepiscopal Excellency’s most reverential and devoted,

<p>Dr. F.X. Eggersdorfer</blockquote>

<a name="15bb"></a><p><strong>June 17, 1919</strong> Faulhaber to Eggersdorfer:

<blockquote>Most Esteemed Herr Professor!

<p>For the informal report, best of thanks. I had in the meantime ascertained the text of the agreement about schooling, in which the inter-denominational school is not set down as the norm. Then, that  the raising of the age for confirmation arose from pastoral circles and not from politician circles, as well other information you specified, I have shared with my Ordinariate this morning. An insuperable difficulty still remains in the fact that our people will not understand that even though there is a specified age as the threshold of religious maturity, yet parental discipline continues in regard to religious obligations.  It will be very difficult to represent the position in a popular assembly that a 12- or 14-year-old can change his religious affiliation without asking his parents, while on the other hand he cannot absent himself from religious instruction without the consent of his parents. And as to this latter point, the preservation of parental disciplinary rights that continue past the 14th year, this can still not be given up. 

<p>The most distressing thing is that these new agreements are in part contradictory to the provisions of the Concordat, and so those types of agreements had to coordinated in advance with the Nunciature. I suspect that the delay up to now of the Indult I am so longingly awaiting, which would enable negotiations with the new Government about appointments to parish pastor positions, is traceable back to the cultural program of Minister Hoffmann. It is in the Bavarian Volkspartei’s own interest to give the earliest possible explanations to Church authorities, since we are always only hearing the Kulturkampf-ish decrees of the Education Minister, but never anything of the counter-measures of our political representatives. 

<p>In the resolutions of the Lower Bavarian Farmers Association, it especially pleased me that the rights of the parents are so strongly demanded, and the governmentally compelled school is rejected.  For Upper Bavaria nothing has happened up to now, as far as I know, against the teacher training institutes.

His Excellency desires that the commission, given the significance of the matter, might be delegated by the entire Episcopacy, even if it will consist of just a few members.

<p>At the moment new alarming reports are going through the press about the suppression of monastic teacher training institutes, etc. We were with Hoffmann yesterday and asked him about this and about the matter of co-education in the middle schools. The instructions about narrowing the quota for secular teachers did not go out from him, but rather as the result of earlier (pre-revolution) consultations of the competent authorities in Munich. It was apparently not really a matter of a Kulturkampf action, but rather one of a restriction on the number of new students in the secular teacher training institutes for 1919/20 that affected all including the secular institutes. In the co-education issue, our position shall come under consideration in one of the upcoming negotiations.  Hoffmann appeals to the fact that he only took up measures that had been implemented by bourgeois governments in Baden, Württemburg and Hesse, and in part in Prussia.

<a name="15d"></a><p><strong>June 19, 1919</strong> Faulhaber to the Bavarian Bishops:

<blockquote>Your Bishop-Graces!

<p>The Most Reverend Lord Archbishop of Bamberg is giving today the suggestion by express mail, for the parliamentary consultations about the constitution outline, that a theological commission be placed at the disposal of the Bavarian People’s Party as a quiet adviser, in order to review in advance the ecclesiastical harmlessness and acceptability of individual provisions to formulate public statements and modifications and additions. It is expressly remarked that the delegates of the Bavarian People’s Party themselves desire the establishment of such a commission, which can make decisions in the name of the Bishops. Given the enormous significance of such advice about the new constitution, which will decide about the State-Church life of Bavaria, nothing in this matter may be delayed.

<p>The Lord Archbishop declared himself ready if needed to summon to Bamberg the commission members specified by the individual Bishops, whereby the named members can also be empowered by the several Bishops. Since this commission must work on the one hand as expeditiously as possible, and on the other hand as inconspicuously as possible, it is recommended that a not overly large number of experts be engaged, and to the extent possible, those who otherwise are already in Bamberg. I am thinking that Auxiliary Bishop Dr. Senger, a professor at the Bamberg University, Dr. Wohlmuth, Dr. Eggersdorfer (to whom I assign the representation of my Diocese) would be sufficient, if it would be possible for His Excellency the Archbishop of Bamberg to take part personally in the most important consultations, or if His Grace the Bishop of Eichstätt were reachable in individual cases and not, like most of us presently, committed to trips for confirmations. For the formulation and presentation of an issue in the press, Cathedral Deacon Dr. Kiefl has a very special knack. 

<p>Thereby I allow myself the following remarks:

<p>First of all, the parliamentary side of the Government must be brought around to putting themselves in contact with Church authorities as to Church-related issues, and not merely through delegates as intermediaries. In decisive essential points, where we bear heavy responsibility, we can indeed only ourselves make the decision and not hand it over to the members of a commission.

<p>Secondly, the commission must also not forget that insofar as points under negotiation touch upon the relationship between Church and State, and thus more or less the Concordat, neither the Episcopate nor the commission is competent, but rather only the Nunciature. Here the People’s Party must remind the Minister for Education and Religion, either in a private meeting or in a public session, that the Concordat is a bilateral treaty under international law and therefore cannot be handled unilaterally by the Bavarian Government like a mere piece of paper without diplomatic interaction with the ecclesiastical side. If the Bavarian Government were to deny diplomatic respect again and unlawfully violate even one point of a lawful treaty, then the political representation would have to, either directly or via the Bishops, inform the Apostolic Nunciature, so that the Holy Father can register a timely protest or otherwise say a clear word to Catholics in Bavaria about our situation.

<p>The Lord Nuncio has at the moment, upon the orders of His Holiness, taken up residence in Switzerland (Rorschach); but our correspondence is sent daily to him under seal. I can observe confidentially that the “agreement” between the Bavarian Government and the People’s Party about the Government program, which indeed outlined the new culture policy, namely in the unsettling sentence at the top: “The People’s Party obligates itself to the implementation of the following program,” was received with great distress by the competent Church authorities, as this text must have aroused the impression that all further negotiations and amendments of the outline were ruled out in advance. In any case, the religion policy of the Bavarian Government cannot be established constitutionally without a clear enunciation of its relationship to the Concordat.

<p>I am thinking that the advisory commission should prepare the question of school policy, which is ... that of church policy, and prepare them both in the same way. Also on this point I request that the answers of the Most Reverend Lords be sent directly to Bamberg, since from Sunday on I will be out for three weeks for confirmations. The April decree [about school policy] which frees male and female teacher candidates who were not in the war to send themselves into religion and music as examination subjects, has meanwhile occasioned my Diocesan Ordinariate to register a protest with the Ministry, with the agreement of the other Ordinariates...</blockquote><br>

<a name="15e"></a><p><strong>June 19, 1919</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri:

<blockquote>Re: Political-religious situation in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence, 

<p>The situation in Bavaria, not only from a social point of view, but also from a political-religious perspective, continues to appear full of dangers, and the interests of the Church appear to be seriously threatened, so that there is increasing fear that the prediction of the Archbishop of Munich may be realized, from the sermon he delivered on December 31st last year, when he warned the faithful even then that if separation of Church and State is carried out in Bavaria, it will be done not according to the American system, but in the French manner. 

<p>The object of new concerns has been the text of the proposed Constitution, presented by the Hoffmann Government at the end of this May (Enclosure I). In it is clearly revealed the influence of two different tendencies, both of them, however, hostile to the Church: on the one hand, that of the liberal-bureaucratic spirit reigning from the times of the famous von Lutz Ministry, and on the other hand, radical anticlericalism, begun by the first revolutionary Ministry. In this way Bavaria, as during the Bolshevik agitation, would seem to want to be first in Germany also in anti-religious evolution. 

<p>Yet such a proposal could not produce surprise, since it emanated from a purely Socialist Ministry.  Shortly after its publication, however, a Coalition Cabinet was constituted in Bavaria, as is certainly well known to Your Most Reverend Eminence. In it the Bavarian Volkspartei (former Center Party), although it was the most numerous party in the Landtag, obtained only two portfolios, those being the Ministry of Agriculture (Baron Freyberg) and that of Finance (Mr. Speck), just like the Democratic Party which, although it could count on half the Deputies, also has two Ministries (Justice – Dr. Müller; and Commerce – Mr. Hamm), while the Socialist Party, which is the strongest party only after the Center Party, counts in the new Government all of five members, among whom Hoffmann has the Minister Presidency and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs. But what is even more serious, contemporaneously with the announcement of the formation of the said Cabinet, the agreements (Vereinbarungen) concluded on this occasion among the three said parties were also published, to the implementation of which the respective delegations in the Landtag had jointly obligated themselves. In truth, in the part of these agreements regarding Culture Policy, there are various points which cannot fail to cause grave concerns. Such as, for example, the Catholic religion no longer has any prerogatives vis-à-vis the State, since all religious societies without distinction enjoy equal rights and equal protection from the State; their property rights and the existing obligations of the State toward them are to be suppressed by means of a law (at least as to this aspect), etc. In what then concerns the most important school question, the doctrine of the Socialist Party prevails. The well known decree of Minister President Hoffmann of this past January, which bestowed the right of parents and guardians not to have their children attend religious instruction, is not only accepted in the aforementioned agreements, notwithstanding all the protests of the Catholic population, but even made worse, to the extent that the option is given to students, who have reached the age of sixteen, of not attending such instruction, even without the agreement of their parents. Also permitted is the inter-denominational school if desired by a majority of the parents and guardians, etc. Certainly it is impossible to fail to recognize the extraordinary difficulties of the present hour, especially the danger of new political-social upheavals, while I also do not believe that the good intentions of the leaders of the Bavarian Volkspartei can be called into doubt.  But in religious questions there are limits that Catholics are not allowed to transgress, just as there are other points that they can endure but not endorse. In particular, then, it is deplorable that the aforesaid party has accepted those fundamentals without taking account that they, at least in part, are in opposition to the Concordat and thus violate the rights of the Holy See. And that is why, as soon as I became aware of the agreements in question, by means of the public press, I immediately wrote to the Archbishop of Munich expressing my surprise at the Catholics having straightaway given in on extremely serious matters that have not only previously been the subject of public demonstrations by the Bavarian Bishops, but also touch upon the Concordat. I therefore asked him courteously to furnish me news in this regard and above all to inform me how, why and in virtue of what authorities the Bavarian Volkspartei presumed to conclude agreements that also contradict Concordat provisions, and what guarantees this party had moreover obtained eventually in compensation, for the future of the Catholic Church.

<p>Archbishop von Faulhaber has now responded that he has been able to ask about the reasons from the priest and Professor Dr. Eggersdorfer, member of the Bavarian Volkspartei. He stated that the program of the new Government as published in the press does not correspond fully and literally with the official text. Moreover, the passage that is found at the head of the agreements in question: “The parties obligate themselves and their delegations in the Landtag to the implementation of the following program,” is not understood by Dr. Eggersdorfer in the sense that the points there contained are definitively fixed and the way closed to modifications during the public deliberation in the Landtag. Concerning the genesis of these agreements that have very much surprised and terrified the Catholics in Bavaria, the aforesaid Professor recounted that about three weeks earlier, Minister Hoffmann had the leaders of the Bavarian Volkspartei and the Democratic Party come to him, and he declared to them that either both those parties enter the Ministerial Cabinet or the Majority Socialists would have left the government and abandoned Bavaria to Bolshevism. In order to preserve the land from a return of the horrible Councils Republic, the aforementioned parties would be disposed to participate in the government. In the negotiations in this regard, the leaders of the Bavarian Volkspartei would have had before them moreover the even more radical provisions of the ... 

<p>The Archbishop, who did not fail to remind this party by means of Dr. Eggersdorfer of the points that must be upheld in conformity to the doctrine of the Church, adds in his letter that it would not currently be difficult to take away from the Bavarian  Volkspartei the loyalty of the Catholic Bavarians, but that it would be very difficult to succeed in substituting a new political organization for the one already existing. Archbishop von Faulhaber also notes that the concessions by the leaders of the party on the school question are all the less understandable in that the Bavarian Bishops had already explained the line to take in this regard, in a Memorandum sent to every Landtag deputy (Enclosure III).

<p>I thanked the said Archbishop for the information he communicated to me, exhorting him to continue his work in defense of religion and insisting anew upon the rights due the Holy See in virtue of the Concordat, rights that are not licit for Catholics to compromise.

<p>The famous Corpus Christi procession could not take place this year in Munich. Archbishop von Faulhaber indicated to me that he had done his part to have it celebrated, even though the military authorities maintained they could not give any guarantee of security; but the Military Command for the city declared categorically that in Munich a state of war is proclaimed, and not just a state of siege as in other cities of Bavaria, and thus all public gatherings were prohibited. It was feared, moreover, that if religious processions were permitted, it would not be possible to prohibit demonstrations and parades of the Independent Socialists. Thus, notwithstanding the regret of the Catholic population for this omission, it was necessary to yield to force majeure.

<p>This past Sunday, the 15th of the month, the elections in the regions, districts and local communities took place in Bavaria. These had a complex result, on the one hand, a considerable increase in votes for the Bavarian Volkspartei (formerly Center Party), on the other, within the ambit of the Socialist Party, a very notable shift of power in favor of the Independents. The collapse of the old Majority Socialist Party, which shows how much, in a very short time, the process of radicalization of the masses has progressed, is especially apparent in Munich, the city of the Bolshevik Councils Republic. In contrast with the elections to the Landtag this past January, the percentage of votes for the Majority Socialists fell there from 43 to 19%, and increased for the Independents from 5 to 32%, for the Democratic Party went from 19 to 14% and for the Bavarian Volkspartei increased from 26 to 28%.  The 18,331 votes obtained by the Independents in the Bavarian capital this past January leaped on Sunday to 77,284, while those for the Majority Socialists diminished from 117,363 to 45,559.

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>In my respectful Report sent around the 20th of this June (I cannot indicate the precise date, because I transmitted the text, as customary, to Munich for the necessary registration in the Archive), dealing with the current political-religious situation in Bavaria, and particularly the recent Constitution proposal and the agreements (<em>Vereinbarungen</em>) concluded among the parties that entered into the new coalition Cabinet, I had the honor to report to Your Eminence how, in calling the attention of the Archbishop of Munich to various points contained in those agreements that do not conform to the principles of the Church, I had repeatedly and in a special way insisted upon the necessity that Catholics always have regard for the Concordat existing between the Holy See and Bavaria, the provisions of which cannot be licitly altered in any way without the prior consent of the Holy See itself. I caused a similar admonition to be made also, in another confidential and indirect way, to the leaders of the Bavarian Volkspartei (former Center Party).

<p>These measures were not without result. I read, in fact, in the Bavarian newspapers reaching me now (cf. Number 278 herein –Enclosure I – from the <em>Augsburger Postzeitung</em>), that on this June 25th the Commission charged with examining the aforesaid Constitution proposal initiated a general discussion in Bamberg. One of the first speakers was Deputy Held of the Bavarian Volkspartei, who, after raising other criticisms against this proposal, added, “Some provisions make possible some conflicts between the Cabinet Ministry and the Landtag, between the State and religious societies. Moreover, I do not see clearly what position Bavaria is taking vis-à-vis public treaties that it concluded up to now. Is there perhaps thought of a unilateral breaking of the Concordat?  Does the Government have relations with the Holy See? The Bavarian Catholic population cannot be indifferent to this. Has the Government informed the Roman Curia of its existence? Still such an act would have been a necessary obligation of international courtesy. The President of the Reich, Ebert, certainly notified the Supreme Pontiff of the formation of his Government. When the Nuncio in Munich was threatened by Bolsheviks at the time of the dictatorship of the Councils, the then Soviet Minister, Dr. Lipp, apologized. [footnote by Pacelli: This detail is not historically exact, as is already known to Your Eminence.] Has Minister President Hoffmann taken steps to right the wrong committed then against the Nuncio? Has the Constitution proposal been submitted to the supreme ecclesiastical Authorities, to have their judgment about the provisions regarding the Church and the school? Why is it not possible to provide for parish appointments?

<p>“Mid- and lower-level officials allow the files to lie idle, since they do not receive further instructions as to what concerns the relations between the State and the Holy See.  The rights of religious societies are not regulated in the proposal in a sufficient manner; in this regard the Constitutions of Württemberg and Baden are much more favorable and clear. In our proposal there is lacking any distinction between recognized and unrecognized religious societies, and it is not said if these have the rights of public corporations...” [ellipsis in the original]

<p>Minister President Hoffmann, being an anti-religious Socialist, could not dodge these insistent and categorical requests directed to him by the Catholic deputy. He responded: “The Government has opined that the current state of the issue does not yet make it necessary to present the proposal to the supreme ecclesiastical Authorities. The Concordat continues to be in effect. In sections 1 and 2 of paragraph 13 the relevant principles are enunciated. At the time when the drafting becomes definitive, there will be negotiations with the Roman Curia for an immediate reform, modification or abolition of the Concordat.” After having then said, moreover, that the agreements between the three parties of the coalition must form the basis of the new Bavarian Constitution, except naturally any contrary provisions of the Reich Constitution, Mr. Hoffmann expressed himself in this way about the future diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Bavaria: “The German Empire (Reich) will create a Legation at the Vatican. As is well known, the Bavarian Legations will probably stand abolished by the Reich Constitution. It is doubtful that along with a Legation of the Reich there could also remain in Rome a Legation of Bavaria. Minister Preger is presently negotiating at my charge in this way with the central Government.”

<p>The Catholic press echoed the words of Deputy Held. The <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em> of June 26 (Enclosure II) published a notable article – whose substance was also disseminated abroad by a telegram from the Wolff Agency – which, taking off on the issue of appointments to the parishes, where prolonged vacancies have caused grave harms to pastoral care and to the interests of the clergy, attacks the Bavarian Government for not having engaged with the Holy See for the purpose of resolving the pending political-ecclesiastical controversies. The newspaper deems that if this Government would engage with it, then the Holy See, in accordance with its custom, would not be averse to the introduction of a provisional <em>modus vivendi</em>, for example conceding in the issue of the parishes that the State would still continue to exercise the right of presentation, naturally on the condition that it would fulfill, in its turn, its correlative Concordat obligations.

<blockquote>Re: The situation in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The news coming from Bavaria continues to be not very comforting. Despite the apparent tranquility, the much longed for state of secure calm has not yet arrived; indeed hidden forces are at work, now no less than before, in Bavaria just as in the rest of Germany, seeking to bring Bolshevik ideals into actual practice. 

<p>Naturally the tactical methods for this purpose have needed be changed. After the fall of the Councils Republic, it was not possible under the government of the military authorities for the apostles of Bolshevism to whip up the masses in public gatherings. The tactics of Spartacism have known how to adapt themselves prudently to the changed circumstances. They have dispersed into the darkness; but leaflets promoting the Bolshevik cause and announcing its upcoming triumph show its persistent underground work. Words carelessly escaping the leaders and followers of Communist circles clearly reveal that at present indeed in Bavaria the forces of extreme radicalism are coming together to erupt violently one day throughout the land and overthrow the new current Government that was so painfully put together. In recent weeks agitators have taken especially targeted personnel of the communication services, seeking in every way to win them over to Bolshevism in the hope of attaining the “liberation of the proletariat” by paralyzing all of economic life via continuing strikes. Fortunately in Bavaria up to now these persons have not allowed themselves to be seduced into such chicanery; also some agents of these important services have communicated to the Authorities their various observations. Thus it is known that foreign agitators are continuing to pass through Bavaria for the purpose of having secret meetings and discussions, preferring to get off at secondary stations. Where the financial means are coming from, then, for such active propaganda, is a mystery only to those who do not know the organization of the Bolshevik movement.

<p>All the signs – including the trials underway in the military tribunals in Würzburg, Schweinfurt, etc. – show that the home ground of agitation for Bavaria is not exclusively Munich, although this city remains the rendezvous point for all the dangerous elements. The Independent Socialist Party, which from the electoral victory this past June has received new impetus, constitutes for the Socialists the corridor that leads to the camp of the Spartacists. Their press alerts of local uprisings, in Bavaria as elsewhere, let the workers know that the days of new battles and definitive victory are not far off, and exhort them to keep ready for the great decisive hour.

<p>It is to be hoped that the Governing Authorities, after the terrible experience of last April, are energetically and promptly taking appropriate measures to prevent the return of such tumults and to assure the Country of the tranquility and order that are indispensible for its restoration.

<a name="17b"></a><p><strong>July 12, 1919</strong> Letter from Ambassador Otto Baron von Ritter zu Groenesteyn to Nuncio Pacelli</strong>:

<blockquote>Strictly Confidential!

<p>Dear Archbishop!

   <p>Today I received an inquiry concerning you personally from Herr Minister President Hoffmann in Bamberg.

   <p>I believe I am acting properly by transmitting to you herewith the text of the inquiry, with the request that you tell me as soon as possible what answer I should give to this.

   <p>The inquiry is presumably occasioned by the discussion in the Bavarian Constitution Committee, which is surely known to you.

   <p>During a talk provoked by Delegate Held, the Minister President spoke of the Nunciature in Munich.  Its preservation, in his opinion, is very much in question, but they are inclined to the view that it should continue to exist.  On account of the Concordat, they will be negotiating in any event about concordats, if legislation makes it necessary.  That will occur if there is intervention in the relationship of State and Church.

   <p>Within the Government it appears to everyone that in order to awaken sympathy for this, it is your duty to enter the Nunciature, and that it was a mistake to disregard it in the manner that has unfortunately occurred.  Many of the delays must be laid to the account of diplomatic inexperience as well as to the account of the <em>Sturm und Drang</em> [storm and stress] period in which the new men of the Government had their heads full of other things and, so to speak, were fighting for their own existence.  Perhaps now they are feeling secure.

   <p>The inquiry I mentioned can also perhaps be attributed to a desire to enter now into personal contact with you, without having to express that desire directly.  For it may well occur to Herr Hoffman to move in this direction, as it has been outlined to me about him, though it may also be possible that he recognizes duties as Minister President that he must necessarily fulfill now that he has Center Party members in his Ministerial Cabinet.

   <p>So that such personal contact could commence, however, Herr Minister President must first be in Munich.

   <p>In any event, in my opinion, in the inquiry about your return, there is no criticism of any effort to avoid your adjourning your residence in Switzerland.  The subject of the inquiry concerns only your return, not your departure.

   <p>I believe that the desire also exists in Center Party circles to have the representative of the Holy See again in the country, in order to be able to negotiate with it about the important questions that now universally arise.  If these negotiations are excluded or even just made more difficult, then the resulting difficulties in entering into direct relationship with Rome could bring a certain responsibility upon the Vatican, if contact with it is discontinued and harm arises thereby to the Church.  All my efforts are going in that direction, and it would be valuable for me to know if you consider it important wherever possible to prevent a situation where the Government makes unilateral decrees in <em>res mixtae</em> [matters of mixed Church-State interest].  For when matters are decreed in that way, it becomes much more difficult to remedy them.  If the Government is also perhaps not always inclined, at the outset of such-and-such arrangement or legislation to enter into advance contact with the Vatican or even with the Church authorities in Bavaria, then the presence of the Nuncio could well be a hindrance to such matters gaining momentum and this last would, under current circumstances, at least be attained earlier than before.

   <p>All these considerations appear to me to make it advisable that you not remain away from Munich too long, provided naturally, that you are no longer threatened with such dangers as before.  That must, in my opinion, be said to be the responsibility of the inquiry of the Minister President.  The newspapers were muttering some time ago about turbulent movements in Munich.  I do not know, however, to what extent these rumors had or have now any foundation.</blockquote>

   <p>Original German:  

   <blockquote>Heute habe ich eine Ihre Person betreffende Anfrage von dem Herrn Ministerpräsident Hoffmann aus Bamberg erhalten.  Ich glaube richtig zu handeln, wenn ich Ihnen anbei den Wortlaut der Anfrage übersende mit der Bitte, mir so bald als möglich zu sagen, was ich darauf antworten soll.  Die Anfrage ist vermutlich durch die Diskussion in bayerischen Verfassungsausschuss, die Ihnen sicherlich bekannt ist, veranlasst.  Durch die Rede des Abgeordneten Held provoziert sprach der Ministerpräsident von der Nuntiatur in München.  Die Erhaltung derselben, so meinte er sei zwar fraglich, aber man neige zu der Ansicht dass sie weiter bestehen könne.  Wegen des Konkordates werde man jedenfalls mit den Konkordate verhandeln, wenn die Gesetzgebung es nötig mache.  Das werde bei Eingriffen in das Verhältnis von Staat und Kirche geschehen.  Bei der Regierung scheint nach allem dem doch das Verständnis dafür zu erwachen, dass es ihre Pflicht ist, der Nuntiatur näher zu treten, und dass es ein Fehler war, sie so zu vernachlässigen, wie es leider geschehen ist.  Vieles von dem Versäumten muss man aber auf Konto diplomatischer Unerfahrenheit sowie auf Konto der Sturm und Drangperiode setzen, in der die neuen Regierungsmänner den Kopf voll von anderen Dingen hatten und so zu sagen um ihre Existenz kämpften.  Vielleicht fühlen sie sich jetzt sicher.  Der erwähnten Anfrage kann etwa auch der Wunsch zu Grunde liegen, nunmehr einmal in persönliche Fühlung mit Ihnen zu treten, ohne direkt den Wunsch aussprechen zu müssen.  Denn persönlich wird es wohl, Herrn Hoffmann, wie man ihn mir geschildert hat kaum nahe liegen, nach dieser Richtung zu machen, aber es wäre doch möglich, dass er Pflichten des Ministerpräsidenten erkennt, die er gezwungenermassen erfüllen muss, nachdem er Zentrumsleute in seinem Ministerium hat.  Damit es zu dieser Fühlungnahme kommt, muss aber der Herr Ministerpräsident erst einmal in München sein.  Jedenfalls soll nach meinem Dafürhalten in der Anfrage nach Ihrer Rückkehr keine Kritik an derem entgehenden Verlegung ihres Wohnsitzes in die Schweiz liegen.  Es ist in der Anfrage immer nur von der Rückkehr, nicht von der Abreise die Rede.  Ich glaube, dass auch in Zentrumskreisen der Wunsch besteht, bald wieder den Vertreter des Hl. Stuhles im Lande zu haben, um eher in der Lage zu sein, sich der wichtige Fragen, die jetzt allenthalben auftachen, mit ihm in’s Benehmen treten zu können.  Wenn Letzteres ausgeschlossen oder auch nur erschwert wird, dann könnte bei den derzeitigen Schwierigkeiten, direkt mit Rom in Verbindung zu treten, den Vatikan eine gewisse Schuld treffen, wenn eine Fühlungnahme mit ihm unterbliebe und daraus der Kirche Schaden erwüchse.  Mein ganzes Bestreben geht dahin und es wäre mir wertvoll zu wissen, ob Sie das billigen, wo möglich zu verhindern, dass bei uns von den Regierungen in res mixtae einseitig dekretiert werde.  Denn dann wenn einso dekretiert ist, wird es viel schwieriger Remedur zuschaffen.  Wenn auch die Regierung vielleicht nicht immer dafür zu haben sein wird, bei der Entstehung einer solchen Verfügung oder eines solchen Gesetzes vorher in Fühlung mit dem Vatikan oder auch nur mit den kirchlichen Stellen im Lande zu treten, so könnte dies doch bei Anwesenheit des Nuntius noch eher verhindert werden, wenn dieser von der Sache Wind bekommt und Letzteres wäre wohl bei den jetzigen Zuständen noch ehe zu erreichen als früher.  Alle diese Erwägungen scheinen es mir persönlich erwünscht erscheinen lassen, dass Sie nicht mehr zu lange von München wegbleiben, vorausgesetzt natürlich, dass Ihnen nicht mehr ähnliche Gefahren wie früher drohen.  Das müsste meines Erachtens bei der Beantwortung der Anfrage des Ministerpräsident gesaget werden.  Die Zeitungen munkelten vor einiger Zeit noch von unruhigen Bewegungen in München.  Ich weiss aber nicht, in wie weit diese Gerüchte begründet waren oder noch sind.

<a name="17c"></a><p><strong>July 15, 1919</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri, transmitting [Pacelli-Edition.de, Dokt. No. 3036] the following memorandum from Matthias Erzberger re the circumstances leading to the signing of the Versailles Treaty by the German Government:

<p>After the Allies and associated governments had rejected the German counter-proposals to the proposed peace treaty of the Allies, conceding only the guarantee of several secondary facilitations, and afterwards had fixed an extremely short deadline (June 23rd) for the decision of the German Government, the latter came face to face with the stark, pitiless question of accepting or rejecting the peace treaty, and, in the latter case, of taking on before its own people the enormous responsibility for a new war. Public opinion, at least as seen in the press, was divided into two camps: one part agitated for signing without reservations, the other for rejection pure and simple. Those for signing without reserve were above all the Independent Socialists, while the Right and the Democrats were making propaganda for refusing to sign. The Majority Socialists and the Center Party, for tactical reasons, had not committed as to the question of signing; but also in those parties, opinion was anything but unanimous.

<p>Also the Cabinet found itself divided into two camps on the question of sign or not to sign.  Especially the Democrats energetically proposed rejecting...
 
<p>... What would have been the situation if there had been a refusal to sign the peace treaty? The Allies would have continued to march into Germany. The state of war would have recommenced immediately ...
 
<p>On June 22nd ... Socialists and Center presented a motion inviting the National Assembly to authorize the Government to sign the peace treaty.  The motion was accepted by 237 votes vs 138 and 5 abstentions. The motion carried with the votes of the Center Party, the Majority Socialists, the Independent Socialists, and some deputies of the Democratic Party.  

<p>[meeting through the night of June 22-23, the new Socialist-Center Party Cabinet could not reach a decision] ... Of decisive importance both for the Center Party and for the troops’ opinion of the Government, was the telegram from the Quartermaster General of the Supreme Army Command direct to the President of the Republic, Ebert, stating that military resistance was hopeless and that the Ministry of War had to assume co-responsibility for concluding the peace... The Cabinet decision on the morning of June 23rd therefore was based on an agreement among the Center Party, the Socialist Party and the army, to sign the peace treaty.

<p>In the afternoon, at 3:00, a session of the National Assembly took place, in which a simple authorization was conferred  on the Government to conclude the peace ...

<p>The Center Party and the Socialist Party now form the Government. In opposition are the Democrats, the right, and the extreme left. It will not be easy for the Center to take on the weight of the Government alone with the Socialist Party. If the Center Party stuck to it, it did it only to prevent the chaos that would have threated the culture and the unity of the Reich, the Church and the State, if a majority had not formed to sign the peace treaty... Germany would have had a Government formed by Independent Socialists or Communists. Placing the Center Party at the disposal of the Government did nothing other than bring the consequence of its responsibility before the German people to bring a guarantee against internal collapse.

<p>It is necessary to add that the Minister of Finance, Erzberger, as the personality directing the peace policy of the Cabinet, is exposed to the fiercest attacks by the rightwing parties and certain circles of officials. Some plans for attempts on his life have been uncovered. The campaign initiated against him by the parties of the right are continuing with the same intensity. He endures the dangers that threaten him with a clear conscience of having done his best for the good of the German people in the hope that the German people will soon recognize that it was better to yield to the brutal violence of the Allies than to go, by refusing to sign, to greater misery.</blockquote>

<a name="17g"></a><p><strong>July 25, 1919</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri:

<blockquote>Re: The School Issue in Germany

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The very serious school question in Germany has recently arrived at a solution, about which I am carrying out my duty to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence.

<p>After long and difficult negotiations, the two parties that currently participate in the coalition Reich Cabinet, the Center Party and the Majority Socialists, arrived on July 14th at a compromise, the text of which I have the honor to send here-enclosed (Enclosure I). It concerns three points: the denominational school, religious instruction, and the private school.

<p>Concerning the first point, it is established that in each Community, the desires of the parents or those responsible for a child’s education will decide whether and to what extent there will be a public simultaneous or inter-denominational school (which will admit students of various denominations) or a public denominational school (for children exclusively from one religious denomination), or a school that is non-religious or laicized.  A Reich law will have to be enacted to resolve the details of this provision, and until then the current regulations will remain in effect.

<p>In this manner, alongside the inter-denominational school and the denominational school, a third type of school has now been introduced, namely the laicized school (long demanded by Socialism), which will not have in its curriculum any religious instruction, but instead a course of history of religion or of morals. It needs to be recognized, however, that under current political-social conditions, such a disaster is unfortunately inevitable, and then again, it was achieved that the rights and desires of the parents were made the foundation, in place of the omnipotence of the State. The preservation of the denominational school in individual communities, also as concerns minorities, will thus depend not on the decision of the governing authorities, but on the desires of the parents themselves.

<p>Religious instruction remains a subject of the school curriculum, with the exception (as already mentioned) of the non-denominational or laicized school. The frequenting of this course (like the participation in religious practices) depends on the will of the parents or guardians, in such a way, however, that once they decide, the students remain obligated to follow the instruction in question. Corresponding to this provision, also in the laicized school it is the province of the parents to state if they want their children to attend or not the course of study in religion or morals. 

<p>The aforesaid norms will allow Catholics most of the time to arrange the establishment of a proper denominational school, even if they are in the minority. But, beyond that, in another point of this compromise, which is particularly important for small groups of Catholics in the <em>Diaspora</em>, the possibility of a <em>private</em> elementary school (Volksschule) is also assured in the event that (and only in such event) there is no public denominational school in the respective community. These private schools must be found to be on a par with the public ones as to their organization and academic formation of the teachers, and this academic and technical equality is required also for the pre-existing private schools. In regard to the latter, an improvement has been attained in the sense that the approval of them does not depend on the whim of the Authorities, but must be conceded whenever the conditions prescribed by law are verified. The Socialists feared that such private schools would easily become caste-based institutions for the richest classes; but this concern has been removed by requiring that there must be an appropriate gradation of school fees in a way that also allows the children of the less well-off classes to attend the school.

<p>Finally, the Theological Faculties existing in the State Universities are preserved.

<p>The aforesaid compromise was debated and approved by the National Assembly in Weimar on July 18th. Interior Minister David declared the Government’s acceptance of it. Speakers from the Socialists and the Center Party equally defended the proposal, which on the other hand was opposed by the Democrats, the parties of the right, and the Independent Socialists (Enclosure II).

<p>The above-referenced provisions, like moreover any type of compromise, are certainly far from satisfying all the legitimate aspirations of the Catholics, who saw themselves forced to make sad concessions and surrenders; nonetheless, considering the current circumstances, it is to be hoped they will be approved by the National Assembly also in the third reading of the Constitution, despite the very strong and growing opposition movement that is being attempted against them.

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>From the Bavarian newspapers reaching me here today (cf. enclosed Nos. 287 of the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> and 205 of the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>), I learn that on July 22 a session took place in Bamberg of the Landtag Committee for Foreign Affairs, in which was discussed, among other things, the question of the Bavarian Diplomatic Corps.

<p>Truly, when Professor Foerster gave his resignation as Bavaria’s representative in Bern, the Cabinet of Ministers proposed to the aforesaid Commission not to proceed with the appointment of a new title holder, since, according to the new Reich Constitution, Bavaria will lose the right to have its own Foreign Legations.  This proposal was approved by the Commission. As to what concerns diplomatic relations with the Holy See, nevertheless, Minister President Hoffmann stated that “for the Nunciature the question is different,” and indeed the Democratic deputy Dr. Piloty affirmed that “the Foreign Legations are useless for Bavaria <em>with the exception of the Nunciature</em>.”  In this way it will remain the sole diplomatic representation in Munich, and it is believed (although there was no special mention of this) that the Bavarian Legation to the Holy See will also be able to be correspondingly preserved.

<p>As to the Legations to the other States of the Reich, it seems that only the one to Berlin will be maintained, except to establish commercial attachés elsewhere.

<p>...the Holy Father said ... in the second part of his talk ... “After we perceived that some decisions were made at the Versailles Peace Conference from which it appeared that they would not leave the rights of preaching the Gospel unimpaired and unrestricted, We turned confidentially to the members of that conference and asked them to turn their attention to these matters.

A particular success was to have the Pope recognized for the first time in a document of international law as the highest authority of Catholics ... Further assignments for the Vatican diplomat were reported by Italian sources: that he had negotiated concerning the Custodianship [over the Holy Places] of the Franciscans in Palestine, the Protectorate over Christians in the Middle East, union with the schismatic Armenian Church, and Hagia Sophia [in Istanbul]. Undoubtedly it was these reports that <em>Osservatore Romano</em> meant when it made fun of all the unfounded “Vatican reports” in its no. 170 of July 3rd concerning the recent mission of Archbishop Cerretti, in which “various Italian and foreign papers reaped a rich harvest of erroneous and unfounded reports.”...

<blockquote>“The Jewish Power - Jews and Bolsheviks”

<p>The Jew! Bismarck, Beaconsfield, the French Republic, Gambetta, etc., all that, absolutely is only a mirage.  It is the Jew alone and his Bank that is their master, for them and all Europe.  All of a sudden, he says <em>veto</em>, and Bismarck falls like a withered plant.  The Jew and his Bank are today the masters of everything, of Europe, of instruction, of civilization, of socialism, <em>above all socialism</em>, by which the Jew will snatch away Christianity and destroy civilization.  And, when there is nothing left but anarchy, the Jew will place himself in charge of everything.  Because, in propagating anarchy, the Jews will remain united among themselves; and when all the riches of Europe are dissipated, there will remain the Bank of the Jews.

<p>This prophecy, written by Dostoyevsky in 1880 and recounted in the <em>Libre Parole</em> of June 13, 1919 at the head of an article entitled “XXX” on the law of the Talmud, we are seeing implemented before our eyes.

<p>Let us look towards Eastern Europe.  Poland re-arises; but, knowing what she once was, on the borders of the Orient, the great Catholic power, and that she will only have a future by taking up again this tradition, the Jewish International unceasingly engages its universal propaganda against the reborn nation.  Analysis of the facts shows us the natural alliance that exists, on this point, between the interest of the Jews and the interest of the German Empire.

<p>“Jews and Bolshevism”

<p>The <em>Matin</em> posed the question, on June 2, 1919: “What mysterious order stopped the allied troops at the gates of Petersburg and of Budapest, at the moment when they were on the point of finishing off Bolshevism?” And it did not hesitate to report the opinion of a Russian arriving from Petersburg and accusing the high influence of financiers. This confirmation, unexpected in such a place, of the thesis maintained in the Senate by Mr. Gaudin de Villaine (session of May 13, 1919), incited Mr. Albert Monniot to sum up the situation in several sentences in the <em>Libre Parole</em>.

<blockquote>A dark power dominates the visible powers who are discussing peace terms, and is dictating their resolutions, as it directed the events of 1914: that is the <em>businessman</em> of the Anglo-Saxons, that is the Financier International, that is, to call it by its real name, the Jewish High Bank. (<em>Libre Parole</em>, June 3, 1919).</blockquote>

<p>To be sure, rigorous proof of such a trenchant affirmation cannot yet be provided; but will anyone deny that everything is happening as if this affirmation was scientifically established?

<p>The <em>Correspondant</em>, which is certainly not suspected of antisemitism, recently gave, unfortunately unattributed, an article of very great historical interest on Russian Bolshevism considered from this point of view.  <em>La Croix</em> reproduced the essential part:

<blockquote><strong>The Bolshevik chiefs.</strong> - A significant fact is the extraordinary number of Jews at the head of the Bolsheviks: 75 of the 100 “commissars” who have the general direction of the party are Jews, and influential Jewish personages in the Soviets are legion.

<p>It is remarkable that the Jews have judged it good to keep Russian pseudonyms that they had previously adopted, as a protective measure, so to speak, against the police.  Trotsky’s name is Bronstein, he is an Israelite and a journalist.  Zinoviev’s name is Apfelbaum, he likewise is a Jew and a journalist.  Sverdlov is a Jewish pharmacist.  Kamenev is really named Rosenfeldt; he is a Jew who has done university studies.  Ouritski, the man who “made” the elections, is a Jew whose name is Moise Salomonovitch.  Joffe, Rakivski, Radek, Menjinski, Larine, Bronski, Zalkind, Velodarski, Petrov, Litvinov, Smidovitch, Vorovski, Steklov, etc., are all Jews. (<em>Croix</em>, June 3, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>An article in the <em>Politique</em>, entitled “The Black Pope of Bolshevism,” adds this curious information, from London, which readers of <em>D.C.</em> will appreciate while smiling at the “anti-Jesuitism”:

<blockquote>M.A. Sokoloff, a former Bolshevik, who ceased to be such after the rupture between Bolshevism and the socialist democrats, who collaborated afterwards in the <em>Novaya Jizn</em>, Gorki’s newspaper, traced in the <em>Times</em> a portrait of Dzerdjinsky, the “black pope” of Bolshevism.
<p>Just as, he says, the Catholic Church is governed by a black pope under the title General of the Jesuits, hidden behind the ostensible Pope, Bolshevism has two chiefs: Lenin, the infallible and impeccable, who holds spiritual power, and Dzerdjinsky the unshakeable, to whom is confided the sword of temporal power.

<p>Dzerdjinsky has no other title than “commissar of the extraordinary Commission for the suppression of commercial abuses and counter-revolutionary conspiracies,” a Commission that is the successor of the former police service.  It passes for being completely uninvolved in politics; but a part of its existence has flowed into the prisons and Siberia, and it is there that it had to learn the means of extermination that it makes such remarkable use of today. (<em>Politique</em>, June 15, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>“The Israelites and Poland: Jewish Propaganda and the ‘Pogroms’”

<p>If Bolshevism and Judaism appear to have ties in part, how astonishing is it if the Poles, in a war with Bolshevism, do not feel predilection and love for the Jews?  Perhaps they have had, in some encounters, the heavy hand, and they have not taken sufficient account of whom their blows fall upon.  But from that, to clamor about pogroms, as our socialist newspapers like <em>L’Humanité</em>, the <em>Journal du Peuple</em> and the <em>Populaire</em> are doing along with far too many English and American papers, is going a bit far.  We are always helping provide a new demonstration of the “invisible head of the orchestra” in favor of Israel.

<p>“In England”

<p><em>L’Humanité</em>, in an unusual expression of sympathy with a religious act, informed us that, on June 26th, the entire Jewish population of London took off from work and spent the day in prayer to protest against the “massacres” of Jews in Poland.  Here is the “fraternal message” that the Executive Committee of the Jewish Socialist Party of Great Britain sent on that occasion to the British Labor Party:

<blockquote>A general strike and fast have been proclaimed for 24 hours to protest against the atrocious pogroms and the barbarisms committed with regard to Jews in more than 100 towns in Poland.  Hundreds of persons, including women and children, have been killed, and Polish troops took part in these horrible crimes.

<p>All Jewish workers must participate in our national mourning, and we hope that the Conference of the Labor Party, representing organized labor in Great Britain, will show its solidarity toward the oppressed Jewish nation by voting a resolution condemning the pillage and murders that are being currently produced in Poland as in epochs of barbarism.

<p>The Jewish working class of the entire world wants a free and independent Poland, but these atrocities are a shame upon the Polish nation and upon humanity, and it is the duty of every man who is a friend of freedom to protest strongly against them. (<em>Humanité</em>, June 29, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>“In Paris”

<p>The <em>Journal du Peuple</em> reveals to us, for its part, that <em>the same day</em> (which it is not unimportant to confirm) the Permanent Administrative Commission of the French Socialist Party voted unanimously on the motion of the Israelite Rappoport, for the following order of the day:

<blockquote>The Commission, informed by telegraph by the citizen Huysmans, of anti-Jewish pogroms organized by the Poles, raises, in the name of humanity and of socialism, its strongest protest and makes an appeal to the international proletariat to influence Governments and public opinion to put an end to the abominable massacres that are signifying a return to the barbarism of the Middle Ages.

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the admission of the socialist-democratic party of Lithuania to the International should be distinguished. (<em>Journal du Peuple</em>, June 30, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>“In the United States”

<p>One month earlier, Senator Calder, of the State of New York, proposed in the United States Senate, which adopted it unanimously, a resolution conceived as follows:

<blockquote>Wherefore it is reported that innocent men, women and children, particularly of the Jewish religion, are being persecuted and massacred in Poland, in Romania and in Galicia;
<p>Therefore:

<p>Be it resolved by the United States Senate that the State Department be and is, presently, invited to communicate this news to the President of the United States, and to ask him to confer with the representatives at the Peace Conference from the countries where it is reported that these massacres and persecutions took place, and to let them know that this Assembly and the American people in their entirety profoundly deplore the acts of cruelty committed against men, women and children on account of their race or their religion. (<em>New York Sun</em>, May 27, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>This vote was the point of departure for ardent polemics in the press of the United States.  Certain major newspapers pronounced from on high:

<blockquote>Since the Great Powers are demanding explanations from the Italian Government on the subject of troop landings in Asia Minor, why are they not also demanding of the Polish Government not only explanations, but the cessation and suppression of outrages victimizing the Jews of that country? The new Poland is a child born of the Conference... It would be a scandal if the Poles were to abuse the freedom they were just given by refusing it to a great number of their fellow citizens... (<em>New York Times</em>, May 23, 1919)

<p>In denying that the Poles were capable of pogroms, and in attributing the news about it to German propaganda, Mr. Paderewski, President of the Council of Poland, is badly informed.  This news came to the United States from numerous sources that have no possible connection to Germany, and in many cases the Jews of the United States have the means to confirm the facts.  They are also capable, in many cases, of proving the absurdity of the claim that the victims are Bolsheviks or supporters of Bolshevism.  The facts are open and obvious, and the best thing the Polish Government could do is to stop denying them and to promise that the massacres will stop. (<em>Springfield Republican</em>, May 29, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, not all the American press is speaking in this tone to Poland, and these calm and reasonable words can fortunately be read in the <em>Boston Transcript</em>:

<blockquote>The first move by informed and reflective people should be to consider with a surprise bordering on incredulity the accusation that the massacres of Jews that have been said to be committed have been done by the Poles, and that the Polish Government is responsible for them... Given that through the centuries Poland has given proof, in religious matters, of a proverbial tolerance and has given asylum to persecuted Jews from other countries, and that one of the first acts of its new Government was to give Jews the same civil rights as members of other religions, it would be truly extraordinary if this country were to renounce its secular policy and were to put into practice a violent antisemitism.

<p>For similar reasons, one will be naturally and strongly brought to the suspicion that Germany is not unrelated to these massacres.  It is a well known historical fact tht Frederick II prepared his departure from Poland by having Germans, disguised as Poles and Jews, commit horrible atrocities against members of other religions in Poland... There is reason to suspect that Germany is currently playing a similar game.  The massacres are probably either committed or encouraged by Germany, or again these are victims of criminal Bolsheviks introduced into Poland by Germany to create troubles.  Such a policy would constitute, for Germany, a totally natural attempt to take revenge for the liberation of Polish provinces that were long kept under the German yoke.  (<em>Boston Transcript</em>, May 26, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>“Pogroms and Lynchings”

<p><em>The World</em> goes further.  It declares itself in favor of Poland.  It bluntly responds to Calder’s motion in a manner that our friendship for America would have prevented us from saying so crudely, namely that if the Poles have their pogroms, the Americans have their lynchings ...

<p>“The Organization of the Calumny”

<p>According to what President Paderewski has solemnly affirmed, the German propaganda services have organized throughout the world the dissemination of appalling calumnies.  <em>L’Ordre Public</em> decries with precision the procedures employed:

<blockquote>Since the Armistice, hardly a week goes by without dispatches that signal some pogrom against Jews in Poland.  Now, all these reports, without exception, have been launched from Germany.  The most frequent source is the <em>Wolf Agency</em> itself, which informed the universe of a new massacre of Jews by the Polish population...

<p>The Jews of Poland, during the war, were in general pure Germanophiles. Many enriched themselves in a scandalous way, and finally they furnished to Bolshevism its principal agents. (A.V., <em>Ordre Public</em>, June 30, 1919) (footnote: An interesting article in the <em>Times</em> (July 21, 1919) confirms the previously cited reasons for the unpopularity of the Jews: Germanophilism, Bolshevism, monopolizing and speculation.  It adds this detail, frequently employed by the Germans or Austrians in making requisitions, that the Jews would requisition far more commodities than were necessary, thus giving them stocks of merchandise they would sell at exorbitant prices. (Note by <em>D.C.</em>)</blockquote>

<p>“The German Interest in This Propaganda”

<p>The <em>Times</em>, for its part, puts matters in focus with a particular authority, having published so many articles favorable to the Israelites; it shows, moreover, the German interest in making it believed that Poland is beset by antisemitic troubles:

<blockquote>Dateline Warsaw, June 15th:

<p>The attitude of certain English and American gazettes that are accustomed to exaggerating at will the importance of local troubles that are produced in certain parts of Poland, to transform them into a pogrom, has caused here a painful impression.

<p>The tragic accounts that have been given of the pogrom of Czestochowa are greatly exaggerated; and, if it is accurate that a certain number of Israelites were mistreated by the crowd, it is still more certain that the authorities cracked down strongly against the makers of these disorders.

<p>Without wanting to excuse the guilty, who will certainly be severely punished, it is appropriate to reveal certain facts that will shed a new light on these incidents.  It is beyond doubt that the crowed was stirred up by German provocateurs.

<p>The Polish authorities have in their hands a most curious document that proves Germany is trying to provoke anti-Jewish troubles in Poland.  It is a memorandum addressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to his foreign diplomatic representatives, which concludes with these words:

<p>“The results attained to date are very interesting; they commit us to continue our campaign in the same spirit.  The time has come to put our propaganda into action.  If we manage to isolate Poland diplomatically, France’s situation on the continent will weaken.” (<em>Temps</em>, June 18, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>It is a pleasure to see, at almost the same time, equally just ideas expressed in an English organ as widely circulated as the <em>Morning Post</em>:

<blockquote>What is the pernicious and sinister influence that is working in the Allied Councils against the cause of Poland?  We believe it is the secret and despicable influence of international finance.

<p>We see, for example, that the Peace Conference placed the Jews of Poland under the special protection of the League of Nations.  Nevertheless, the Conference of Polish Jews, which desires to be loyal subjects of the Polish State, protested that they are content with the protection of the Polish Government.

<p>Today, it is amply proven that there is an organized campaign of lies and exaggerations against Poland.  For months, we have been receiving detailed accounts of pogroms that have never taken place…The truth is that there is now a quasi famine reigning in Poland, and that the shops, of which a great number are Jewish, have been looted by the crowd.  Then, in the combats between the Poles and the Ukrainians and the Bolsheviks, some Jews were captured who were fighting in the ranks of the enemy, and these Jews were killed by firing squads.  That is what this scaffolding of lies has been built upon.  Why?  Is it to discredit the Poles in England and in France just at the moment when the Germans are going to attack them?  That is what it all looks like. (<em>Morning Post</em> of London, June 27, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>“The Privileges of Jews Assured by Article 93 of the Treaty of Versailles”

<p>All these maneuvers, even if openly visible, were yet not in vain.  They succeeded in assuring to the Jews of Poland these extraordinary <em>privileges</em> specified in the <em>Letter of the President of the Peace Conference</em> to Mr. Paderewski and in the special treaty aimed at Poland.  

<p>It is Article 93 of the Treaty of Versailles that gave the principal allied and associated powers the right to intervene in Polish affairs.

<p>Art. 93. – Poland accepts, in agreeing to the insertion into a treaty with the principal allied and associated powers, such provisions as the Powers judge necessary to protect in Poland the interests of inhabitants who differ from the majority of the population by race, language, or religion...

<p>“Poland Against These Privileges”

<p>All the Polish press rose up against this article, that is to say against the bestowing of particular international guarantees to national or confessional minorities. For example ...

<p>“Fusionist and Nationalist Jews”

<p>But it is even much more interesting to see a portion of the Polish Jews themselves take a position against the guarantees that the Conference wants to impose on them...

<p>“Important Protest of the Diet of Warsaw”

<p>To what extent such pretensions go against national Polish sentiment, is easy to confirm in reading the motion adopted by the Diet of Warsaw, <em>unanimously</em> and without discussion, in the session of June 6, 1919, on the proposition of the national popular Union and the populist Association:

<blockquote>The Diet of the Polish Republic affirms that Poland is not a new State, but one of the most ancient States of Europe, possessing uninterrupted traditions of liberty and justice.  The Polish Republic has never oppressed any nation, nor conducted any annexation, nor undertaken any religious persecution...

<p>The Diet expresses the conviction that the Allies will recognize the wrong influcted on Poland by this proposition and that this article will be modified…</blockquote>
<p>Despite this unanimous motion, the Paris Conference maintained Article 93, and we will see what consequences it produces.

<p>“The Conference Is Not Inspired by Justice, but by Certain Interests”

<p>Nothing, in theory, justifies them.  Mr. Francois Bujak, Professor at the University of Krakow, summaries this issue of law in some luminous lines:

<blockquote>Poland cannot refuse the possibility to constitute a modern State completely on a par with the other civilized States that currently exist.  It cannot therefore give to the Jews more rights than are given to immigrant populations by States having an extremely liberal organization such as the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland or France, which welcome such great numbers of immigrants.  The State of New York in the United States possessed in 1910, out of 10,647,000 inhabitants, 1,603,000 Jews who constituted at least 16 percent of the population, being thus a greater proportion than in Poland.  It will be curious to see if the Jews put forward the same political claims there as in Poland, and how they will be received by the local population.

<p>Poland cannot permit itself to be treated as an experimental field for the application of conjectural and quite simply utopian theories; on the contrary, it should make all its concern to act in such a manner that the Jews are treated there exactly in the manner they are in the other States. (<em>La Question Juive en Pologne</em>, by Francois Bujak [Paris, Levé, 1919], p.41.)</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that only interests (but no principle, even Wilsonian) are taken into account in such matters.  Mr. Georges Bienaimé does not hesitate to say in the <em>Victoire</em>:
<blockquote>What have they done then, the “great States,” for the past six months, that gives them such superiority in reason and authority?  How have they conducted themselves, for example, vis-à-vis Bolshevism?

<p>It is not their fault if Romania and Poland have not been Bolshevised.  It is, on the contrary, to the energy of the “little States” that one owes the stopping of Bolshevism and its current reflux.

<p>The “great States” have only shown incoherence and egotism in this matter... not to speak of that there.

<p>They have obeyed considerations that are dictated to them by financiers more often than by men of the heart...

<p>In the world of finance, a persistent hostility appears against Romania and Poland...</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>“An Example for Catholics: the Tactics of Jews”

<p>There is great interest in putting into evidence the tactics that the Jews follow to arrive at such a considerable result.

<p>Not content to agitate the world by incessant press campaigns or by American and Anglo-Saxon meetings, they had an official note sent to the Peace Conference, on February 20, 1919, by the Central Committee of the <em>Alliance Israelite Universelle</em>, in which they expressed their <em>desiderata</em>.

<p>This note was reproduced by <em>D.C.</em> (issue no. 10, April 12, 1919, p.315); we recommend to our readers an examination of the six articles of Jewish claims there.  They cannot fail to be struck in seeing these articles pass into force of international law in the treaty signed on June 28, 1919 between the United States, England, France, Italy and Japan, on the one side, and Poland on the other.

<p>“The Articles of the Treaty Concerning ‘Ethnic Minorities’”

<p>After having posited, in article 2 of this treaty, the principle of freedom of “every faith, religion or belief, whose practice will not be incompatible with public order and good morals”; in article 7, the principle of equality of citizen of whatever “religion, belief or confession” they may be, and the free usage of their language, even before tribunals, “notwithstanding the establishment of an official language by the Polish Government”; after have assured, by article 8, to Polish residents belonging to ethnic minorities of religion or language, the right to “create, direct and control at their expense charitable, religious or social institutions, schools and other establishments of education, with the right to make free use of their own language there and to exercise freely their religion”; after having prescribed to the Polish Government, by article 9, to accord “in cities and districts where there reside a considerable proportion of Polish residents of a language other than the Polish language, appropriate facilities to assure that, in the primary schools, instruction will be given in their own language to children,” all in maintaining mandatory instruction in Polish in the aforesaid schools, the Great Powers make obligatory, by the same article 9, section 2, the redistribution among these minorities of an “equitable portion of the benefices and the allocation of public funds for the budget of the State, the budgets of municipalities or others, for a purpose of education, or religion, or of charity.”
<p>And one sees what part the Jews will have been able to take in these various articles, which, without naming them, are directed primarily at them.

<p>“The Articles of the Treaty Specially Concerning the Jews”

<p>But the Treaty of Versailles contains two articles in which the Jews, openly designated, see their privileges affirmed and find themselves established on the face of the world, despite denials and by the force of the texts, as a sort of little State within the Polish State by the will and under the control of the League of Nations:

<blockquote>Art. 10. – School Committees, designated at the locality by the Jewish communities of Poland, will assure, under the general control of the State, the redistribution of the proportional part of public funds assigned to Jewish schools in conformity with article 9, according to the organization and direction of these schools.

<p>The provisions of article 9 concerning the use of languages in the schools will be applicable to the aforesaid schools.

<p>Art. 11. – The Jews will not be compelled to carry out any kind of actions that constitute a violation of their Sabbath, and shall not incur any incapacity if they refuse to appear before tribunals or to carry out legal actions on the Sabbath day.  At the same time, this provision will not dispense Jews from obligations imposed upon all Polish residents in view of the necessities of military service, national defense or the maintenance of public order.

<p>Poland declares its intention to abstain from prescribing or authorizing elections, whether general or local, that would take place on a Saturday; no electoral or other inscription shall be obligatory to do on a Saturday.</blockquote>

<p>“International Guaranty of These Provisions Against Polish Independence”

<p>Article 12 assures the execution of all the preceding provisions.  Paragraph 2 is especially remarkable; it places Poland in several ways at the mercy of a sole intervention by American or by England, and one knows what power the Jews have in these two countries...

<p>In reality, Mr. Clemenceau wrote well in his letter sent to Mr. Paderewski: “<em>One believes</em> that these provisions will not be an obstacle to the political unity of Poland.  They do not constitute a recognition of the Jews as such as a separate political community in the Polish State,” it is permissible to ask oneself what more could have been obtained by the Alliance Israelite Universelle to have the foundations of a Jewish State within the Polish State established by the Treaty of June 28th.

<p>“The Joy of Israel and the Humiliation of the Poles”

<p>It will also not be a surprise to hear the triumphant song of Israel, such as the <em>Peuple Juif</em>, a weekly review edited by the “Zionist Federation of France,” hastened to intone.  The <em>Peuple Juif</em> has the gall to write that “the Jews of Poland hoped for better.”  This is the testimony of an insatiable race which knows that success requires never placing limits on their ambitions.  But the tone of this enthusiastic prose shows well what price is being paid for the Jewish victory.

<blockquote>The Jews are glad to welcome the act of June 28, 1919 that abolished the great Polish injustice…

<p>The Jewish people congratulate each other on this victory of justice, but they want the victory of justice to be complete.  The treaty that was just signed with Poland contains a clause concerning the fate of Jewish populations: these populations will be Polish, but on the condition that religious and educational freedom is assured them, as these clauses promise them.

<p>These clauses also mark an effort toward justice.  The Jews of Poland expected better: they had neatly drawn up their future statute within the Polish framework; the Polish State must now at least apply – without hindrance and without hypocrisy – the measures that assure these freedoms.  The new State and the Jews will know, they hope, how to work together and, in mutual trust, will apply the details of this statute.

<p>There would be no shadow of Wilsonian principles if hatred, contempt, persecutions of all sorts, harder than the pogroms, would not cease with “the peace of justice.” (<em>Peuple Juif</em>, July 4, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>So when will Catholics know how to take the path to such success?  One would say that they do not know what is a well conducted propaganda effort!

<p>In the present case, the Jews do not let an occasion slip: by the power of repeating the same accounts or the same ideas, they manage to create a sort of universal obsession.  They worked so well that President Paderewski had to intervene with Wilson to protest at length against the calumnies and to request an American inquiry…

<p>“Mr. Pichon, the Parliament and the Jews”

<p>...

<p>“The Jews’ Accusations Against Poland Have Been Unjustified”

<p>The Jewish campaign has had everything against it all along except the resolute will of its instigators. But it has not corresponded with reality; it has been a veritable extortion that has been carried out upon the public at large – and upon the Peace Conference, which seems to know nothing more than the public at large about certain essential questions.

<p>It is true that our Socialist newspapers have displayed such a zeal in defending the cause of Israel that Mr. Armand Liebermann, an Israelite deputy in the Polish Diet, could not refrain from writing to Mr. Georges Pioch, of the <em>Journal du Peuple</em>, a letter that not only sets things straight but gives a well-taken lesson:

<blockquote>You see matters from a distance and from on high; do you see their real aspect? The distance and the perspective are favorable, no doubt, for the sentences of history.  But we who are in the furnace, we perhaps have a different conception of events, and their consequences, and their causes.

<p>We sense above all the inopportuneness of foreign interferences, however disinterested they may be, and however just they may appear.  Far be it from me to want to establish a distinction, fragile and fine moreover, between that which is called, by way of euphemism, an excess, and that which bears the terrible name, untranslatable into French, of “pogrom”; the murder of a single innocent victim suffices to move the conscience of the world to want to intervene.

<p>But, if I may ask you anew, is it useful to the cause itself, and are your sure that no exaggeration has come in to color the events imputed to Poland? ...

<p>“Judgments on the Polish-Jewish Question” 

<p>“An Article by a French Protestant”

<p>A Protestant witness, Mr. André Lichtenberger, has sent a report from Warsaw to the <em>Victoire</em>, July 6th, verified on the spot concerning the situation in Poland.  The <em>Victoire</em> of July 11th published this information.  After having recalled that Poland was very tolerant of Jews up to the middle of the last century, Mr. Lichtenberger writes these lines, whose information will be confirmed by history:

<blockquote>What changed the situation was primarily the reflux into Poland of Jewish elements chased from Russia by the Moscow government, and who, as foreigners in the land where they were condemned to live, naturally comported themselves and were received as foreigners.  Under the Russian oppression, they did not dream of reclaiming the Polish nation, and after the Russian collapse, they affirmed more or less categorically the pretention of constituting in Polish territory a nation having special privileges.  The major part among them has notorious Germanophile sentiments and tight affinity with international socialism.

<p>These facts have had their repercussions on the disposition of the masses.  It is accurate to say that what is being manifested there are tendencies that are not properly speaking antisemitic, but rather nationalistic, against some individuals who, while in Poland, have nothing of a Polish mentality.

<p>(footnote: To show, moreover, how everything related to Jews in Eastern Europe should be suspected of being “rigged,” we borrow from <em>L’Ordre Public</em> a curious news item focused on Hungarian Jews: “A strange movement of conversion to Catholicism among the Jews of Hungary is being detected.  Of a population of about a million inhabitants, the City of Budapest counts close to 200,000 Jews.

<p>“Now, for several weeks, it is by the hundreds that Jews are having themselves stricken from the rolls of the Israelite community and are converting to the Catholic religion, in which, after being instructed in religious truths, they are having themselves baptized.

<p>“These new Catholics are being recruited from all classes of society, but especially from the bourgeois class, among the lawyers, the merchants, and the public employees.

<p>“The grand rabbi of Budapest declared to the correspondent of the <em>Corriere della Sera</em> that the majority of Jews who declare the abandonment of their religion do it out of hatred of Bolshevism, of which their co-religionists are the cadre.

<p>“The head of the Hungarian Bolshevik government, Bela-Kun, and <em>thirty out of thirty-five of his ministers</em>, are known to be Jews.  Now, the general conviction is that Bolshevism will not last long.  A great many Jews fear that the population may avenge itself on them for the violence and crimes committed by the Bolsheviks.” (<em>Ordre Public</em>, June 17, 1919) end of footnote)

<p>“A Testimony of a Polish Jew”

<p>The review <em>America</em>, a Catholic organ of information and studies published in New York, has collected, for its part, the declarations of a Polish Jew, a historian and critic, whose testimony is a decisive document:

<p>“A historian of great reputation, Professor Askenazy, who is at the same time a Jew and a Pole, has just given a correspondent of the <em>World</em>, of New York, an interview in which he declares that the hostility between Jews and Poles has been greatly exaggerated.  He condemns the efforts of his co-religionists, especially in New York, that aim to discredit Poland:

<blockquote>Young Poland, which is struggling and which is besieged by its enemies, has enough troubles without the attacks from our people, who have always received better treatment from the Poles than from any other nation in Eastern Europe.  Poland has been the historical refuge of the Jews.  My own family came here 400 years ago; they lived here in peace and security ever since, in the time when, in Germany, in Austria and in Russia, the Jews were abandoned to violence and pogroms.</blockquote>

<p>Professor Askenazy places his co-religionists on guard against the “stories” that are so obstinately disseminated:

<blockquote>Each time a Jew is injured in Poland, the Jews announce that ten of them have been killed and the Germans affirm that a thousand of them have been massacred.  If a Jew is killed in combat, as happened for the Jews of Vilna who fought with the Bolsheviks, the German press immediately spreads a story about “Polish pogrom in Vilna.”</blockquote>

<p>“The troubles, adds the <em>World’s</em> informant, “are without importance and would disappear entirely were they not fomented by ‘international Jews’ operating (in Poland) from Russia and from America.”  And he states that “there has never been in history an event that could qualify to be called a <em>Polish pogrom</em>.” (<em>America</em>, July 12, 1919)

<p>“Personal and Official Reports by Representatives of the Allies”

<p>This testimony adds its force to the confirmations and to the official reports that are grouped in the preceding volume of the same collection:

<p>“The official reports of the representatives of the Entente in Warsaw, summarized in the dispatch from London in the <em>New York Times</em> that we reproduce here below, demonstrate yet again the exaggeration of the “stories of pogroms.”

<p>This is the text of the dispatch:

<blockquote>Official reports on the recent combats between Jews and Poles have just been received here.  By the testimony of Great Britain’s minister in Warsaw, when the Poles entered Vilna the street fighting lasted three days, leading to the death of 34 Polish soldiers and 64 Jews.  Of these latter, 10 were shot in the street battles and the others were executed for having fired down from windows against the Polish troops.

<p>The British minister adds that large quantities of rifles, carbines, ammunition and bombs were found in the homes of Jewish members of the Bolshevik administration who had taken part in the armed resistance against the Poles. (<em>America</em>, July 5, 1919)</blockquote>

<p>Germans, Bolsheviks and international Jews, therefore, have lied.

<p>“Conclusion for Catholics”

<p>Catholics, if they really take to heart bringing their demands to a successful conclusion, will not be obligated themselves to have recourse to lies; they will be carried along by the excellence of their cause and the truth of its principles.  They are not lacking in civic courage and, even more perhaps, knowledge of their religion and their rights, from which they have a clear view of duty to fulfill.

<p>May they at least take, from the example we have shown them in detail, a lesson in propaganda and tactics.

<p>We can envision immediately a practical application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most Reverend and Gracious Herr!

<p>Your Excellency!

<p>Recent days have brought me so much work that I have not been in position to answer the questions that were posed. Upon my return on the evening of the 4th, from Munich, where I had to consult the doctor, I used my first free moments to review the wide-ranging questions that I am to answer and about which I have in the meantime reflected much and which I have weighed much back and forth. 

<p>1. What concerns future appointments to German Bishop positions ...

<p>2. As to what concerns the other concepts that Your Excellency touched upon in the letters of the 5th and 17th of July and which concern the general status of the Church in the realm of the German States and in the German Reich overall, what I perceive is that efforts were also made by the German diplomatic representation at the Holy See to put to rest the objections that the recent negotiations in Weimar, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart etc. must have aroused.

<p>It was also pointed out to me that freedom of conscience and religion really are well recognized in these foundational laws. To be sure these declared the <em>individual</em> to be religiously free, but only in order <em>to be able, unhindered, to turn one’s back on religion</em> and indeed on <em>all</em> religions. The provisions do not have the meaning and intent to exercise no compulsion as to religion. The individual is invited, rather, to liberate himself from all religioin. That is how this concept was already understood by the Revolutionaries of 1848 and represented by them and accepted in “the Foundational Rights of the German People.” One eventually saw through that and, from the actual practice of liberalism, learned it even better. From it no benefit is going to bloom for the Church and for Catholics, and nothing is to be hoped from it.

<p>A “State Church” is something we have not had indeed for a long time. This is indeed no longer a danger and the further warding off of such danger is nothing worth fighting for or giving anything up for. On the other hand, the principle of subordination of the Church to State law, taken up even by Catholics and their leaders and representatives – in the ambit of common law – is so serious a mistake and so great a danger that all the so-called gains, tax receipts, support of universities and the theological faculties in them, recognition of the Church as a society of <em>public</em> right, freedom of appointing to benefices, and so forth completely disappear.  All of that can and <em>will</em> in the future be changed on occasion and the German Bishops, the representatives of the German Catholics, have made themselves defenseless in the face of that. They have <em>without</em> protest agreed to the principles of this subordination of Church to State. Hopefully the Holy See will rescue the ecclesiastical principle even for Germany. The German Catholics have rescued the Protestant “church,” that is, so-called Christianity,  itself and its positions a well-paid theology professors, but the <em>Church</em> is left in the lurch. It must save itself. One has allowed everything to happen to oneself and now is not protesting. Jurists and theologians are praised as “farsighted” and “peaceable.” But I am becoming bitter. The experiences of recent times have made me bitter, because even those are abdicating upon whom I had placed my hopes – the <em>Bishops</em> and the <em>theologians</em>. The all <em>keep quiet</em> and they are trying to make it out to the world that the “Center Party” has really once again come to the rescue.

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The new Constitution of the German Empire entered into effect the 13th of this month by means of its promulgation in the Official State Bulletin (<em>Reichsgesetzblatt</em>). I therefore believe it my duty to give Your Most Reverend Eminence, here-enclosed with the German text, the Italian translation of  the articles that concern relations between Church and State, adding some brief observations or clarifications.

<p><strong>Article 124</strong>

<p>German text ...

<p><em>Italian translation.

<p>All Germans have the right to form associations and societies for purposes that do not violate the criminal laws. This right cannot be limited by preventative measures. The same prescriptions apply to religious associations and societies. 
<p>Every association is free to acquire lawful status in accordance with the provisions of the civil law. This status cannot be denied to an association on grounds that it pursues a political, social-political or religious purpose.</em>

<p>This article is rather important for the Religious Congregations, since it extends to them without limitations the right, to which all Germans are entitled, to found associations. Also, the many restrictions about the acquiring of legal status on the part of the Congregations themselves, in force up to now in all the States of Germany, have been abrogated by the second section of this article; they acquire such status in conformity with all the general provisions of the civil law.

<p>Moreover, in article 138, the aforesaid Congregations are on an equal footing with religious societies as to what concerns the guarantee of their property.

<p>Third section.

<p>Religion and religious societies.

<p><strong>Article 135</strong>

<p>German text ...

<p><em>Italian translation. 
All residents of the German Reich enjoy full freedom of belief and conscience. The undisturbed exercise of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and stands under the protection of the State.  The general laws of the State remain thereby unaffected.</em>

<p><strong>Article 136</strong>

<p>German text ...

<p><em>Italian translation:

<p>Civil and political rights and duties are neither conditioned nor restricted by the exercise of freedom of religion. The enjoyment of civil and political rights, as well as the eligibility for public offices is independent of religious confession.  No one is obligated to disclose his religious convictions. The authorities have the right to inquire into the question of membership in a religious society only to the extent that rights or duties depend upon it or a lawfully ordered statistical census requires it.  No one may be compelled to participate in any church activity or ceremony, or religious exercises, or the use of a religious form of oath.</em>

<p>Articles 135 and 136 concern the personal sphere of law and sanction individual freedom of belief and conscience. Civil and political rights and duties are independent of religious confession; in a particular way, then, it is established that all, without distinction of religion, can be equally eligible for political offices. No one is obligated to disclose their own religious convictions; however, the Civil Authorities can inquire into membership in a religious society “when rights and duties depend upon it.” This clause finds its application in what concerns education of children (classes, schools), church taxes, etc. Such inquiry is also allowed, as is clear, when it concerns statistical surveys ordered by law. Finally, it is noteworthy that the right as to participation in religious activities does not exclude the exercise of authority, with respect to children, by those who responsible for their education, nor would it prevent church disciplinary procedures toward those who freely belong to a religious confession.  As to the religious form of oath, no one can be compelled; nevertheless it is permitted under the norms of articles 42 and 177.

<p><strong>Article 137</strong>

<p>German text: ...

<p><em>Italian translation:

<p>There exists no State Church.

<p>Freedom of association in religious societies is guaranteed.  Formation of religious societies within the territory of the Republic is not subject to any restrictions.

<p>Each religious society will order and administer its affairs independently within the ambit of generally applicable law. It confers its offices without cooperation of the State or civil authorities.

<p>Religious societies are entitled to gain legal capacity according to the general provisions of civil law.

<p>The religious societies remain entities under public law to the extent they were such previously. For other religious societies, they are to be granted the same rights upon application, if they ...</em>

<p><strong>Article 138</strong>

<p>German text ...

<p><em>Italian translation:

<p>The subsidies from the State to religious societies provided by law, agreement or particular title of right shall be cleared by State legislation. The basis for this shall be established by the Reich. 

<p>The property and other rights of religious societies and associations for their establishments, foundations, and other assets dedicated to worship, education and charity are guaranteed.</em>

<p>Article 138 deals with the property of religious societies. The first section establishes that the subsidies from the State to these societies, due according to laws, agreements, or particular titles of right, must be cleared, being substituted with payments of a capital sum or an annual amount, on a basis that will be fixed by laws of the Reich. Among the above-named agreements must be counted above all that concluded with the Holy See.  Not included, however, in the article under consideration are the free or discretionary subsidies from the State in favor of the Church, which, at least in Bavaria, were up to now rather sizeable. In the transitional provisions (art. 173) it is established, then, that until the above-mentioned Reich law is issued, the aforesaid obligatory subsidies must be maintained as they were in the past.

<p>By virtue of the second section, the property of religious societies remains assured, as also their other rights, for example the right to use buildings placed at their disposition by the State.

<p>The aforementioned Commission for the Examination of the Proposed Constitution of the Reich also discussed the question of <em>patronato</em> (private); but, in view of the many difficulties this matter presented, it was decided not to handle it in the Reich Constitution, leaving it instead to legislation of the individual States.

<p>Articles 140 and 141 concern the exercise of religious practices and of spiritual assistance in the army, in hospitals, in prisons and other public establishments. As to what concerns the army, the proposal was not accepted to sanction expressly in the Constitution pastoral care in the military, as it was previously; it is nevertheless to be hoped that it will not bring the result that this institution will be harmed.

<p>The Constitution assures all members of the military the freedom to fulfill their religious obligations; on the other hand, religious societies must be allowed, to the extent there is need, and with the exclusion of any form of coercion, to exercise acts of worship and pastoral care in the army as in other aforementioned public institutions.

<p>As a complement to this respectful Report, may I be permitted to add two judgments concerning the new Reich Constitution.

<p>In the session of the Commission for the examination of the new Bavarian Constitution held this July 23rd in Bamberg, Minister President Hoffmann said this: “Undoubtedly the great tendency of the revolution was to render the Church free from the State and the State free from the Church; but this was not entirely actuated in the Reich Constitution. It made the Church free from the State, but not so much vice versa, the State free from the Church.  The full separation of State and Church awaits another time.”

<p>Monsignor Hollweck, in the last part of his letter of the 7th of this month, transmitted by me to Your Eminence with my obsequious Report No. 13699 dated the 13th of this month, writes as follows: “Also to me is made known that (in the new Constitutions of the Reich, of Baden, of Württemberg, etc.) is recognized the complete freedom of conscience and of belief.  Certainly the individual in these is declared free in religious matters, but only because invidividuals can, without any impediment, turn their backs on religion, and also on all religions. 

<p>“These provisions do not signify an intention to eliminate whatever forms of violence in fact of religion, but are rather an invitation to the individual to free oneself from any religion. The same thought was already supported by the revolutionaries of 1848, who introduced it in the fundamental rights of the German people, and its consequences can be seen in the practice of liberalism. The Church and Catholics cannot expect any salvation from it.

<p>“The State Church has not existed for a long time already. It therefore does not constitute any danger, and the elimination of this danger for the future therefore does not represent any advantage that is worth the cost of sacrificing anything. On the contrary, the principle of the subordination of the Church to the laws of the State – ‘within the ambit of common rights’ – accepted also by Catholics and by their leaders and representatives, is a grave error and such a great danger, compared to the disappearance of all the other so-called advantages, such as the right of collecting taxes, the maintenance of the theological faculties in the Universities, the recognition of the Church as a society of public right, the free appointment of benefices, etc. All this can be and will be made to change in the future, and the Bishops of Germany, the representatives of the German Catholics will find themselves disarmed in the face of such events. They have consented <em>without</em> protest to the maximum degree of submission of the Church to the State. Please God that the Holy See save ecclesiastical first things! German Catholics have saved the position of the Protestant ‘Church,’ it being the so-called Christendom, if it is these and their positions as well-paid professors of theology, but have left the <em>Church</em> in the lurch.  It must save itself. Catholics have all put up with this and are now therefore lauded by the jurists and by Protestant theologians as ‘forward-looking’ and as ‘lovers of peace.’ But I am becoming bitter.  The experiences of these recent times have made me that way, because of so little coming from those in whom I had placed my hope: the Bishops and the theologians. They were called first of all to support the cause of the Church with all their strength; but all kept quiet and sought for the world to believe that the ‘Center Party’ has again saved everything.”  

<p>Thus Monsignor Hollweck.  While recognizing the deficiencies and the weakness of the Center Party in Germany and while deploring the theoretical and practical defects of the new Constitution, especially in what concerns the school question, it nevertheless needs to be not denied that this party does not have a majority in the National Assembly, and thus could not obtain <em>everything.</em> It <em>at least for now</em> has prevented, by its energies, a new <em>Kulturkampf</em> from happening in Germany, and a hostile separation between the two Powers, such as there is in other Nations in Europe, and has warded off the threatening danger that extreme laws might emanate against the Church, for which there have also been guarantees of its properties and affirmation of freedom in the appointments to its offices.

<blockquote>Your Excellency, Most Reverend Lord Archbishop!

<p>Excuse me, that I have not come recently from Bamberg to Munich. Now I would like to come for a discussion if you will kindly allow it with Your Excellency and if possible also with the Most Reverend Lord Nuncio together with Privy Councilor Held. For establishing a point in time that I could convey to the Privy Councilor, I would be grateful.

<p>The reason is this: Our delegation leader Held has earned the greatest credit for the Constitution coming into its current form. We have his tactical prowess to thank for all anti-Church provisions falling by the wayside without struggle or test of strength.

<p>Now Hoffmann wants, after a brief time of vacation, the counsel of Held on account of further Church-policy provisions and the interchange about the Concordat. It is therefore desirable that Held come into complete unity with Church authorities.

<p>Hoffmann intends to have a nice version of the Constitution printed and then go with it personally to the Nuncio, in order to take up negotiations. From what he has said, he had the Most Reverend Lord Nuncio officially received upon his return to Munich. 

<p>It will not escape Your Excellency that the concluding of the teacher law [of Aug. 14, 1919] made extraordinarily big waves. The agreement over the financing of religious education seemed to us an important success and a whole new way of handling it. Otherwise we would have feared the greatest difficulties in the future, if a greater part of the teachers were put down to Biblical stories.</blockquote>

<a name="20a"></a><p><strong>Aug. 23, 1919</strong> F. Schrönghamer-Heimdal, “Weltensturz”:

<blockquote>Do you know what is happening today? It is the final battle between the two world-spirits: between Christ and Antichrist, between Jesus and Judas, between the Godly and Satanic in the world, between the moral powers of life and the powers of darkness, between the eternal German and the eternal Jew – as we may call it. The meaning is always the same. What we see from outside is only the superficial aspect of events of the day. It is the spirit that gives life. It is a spiritual battle, a struggle for the world between spiritual powers.  It is not “world history” in the old historian or diplomat sense that is being made today, but rather spiritual history is being worked out as never before on earth.

<p>Footnote: Compare this to my foundational book “The Coming Reich” (320 pages, Haas and Grabherr publishers, Augsburg C 230, 7.00 Marks). There I trenchantly outlined the events of the time and drew out their inner causes fully one year before they came to pass, and showed the way to a better future.

<p>World in upheaval, really: a millennium is collapsing, but not to be eternally annihilated, rather to arise anew, like the Phoenix from the ashes. It is indeed only the decayed, rotten, outmoded, unsustainable. And since it is not tumbling down of its own, God is sending the “men of revolution.” What are they? None other than instruments, helpers of a higher will, none other than housemaids that are put off in the corner once they have done their work, which consists only in destruction. They cannot build up, as we are already seeing, that is what the others must and will do when their time is come. The purpose of this revolution is really re-construction. How shall the new and better arise, unless the decayed and rotten of the former era is fundamentally destroyed? Granted, much that is healthy will also be ripped into the abyss. But it will come back. What has eternal value is indestructible. And the old God still lives. 

<p>Is it coincidental that throughout the world it is primarily Jews who have executed this work of destruction? To whom do these words not occur, from the Savior, concerning the end of the era: “Truly, this generation will not pass away until all this has happened”? Apparently God is making use again today of the “chosen people” as his instrument: just as Judas once betrayed Jesus and handed him over to the cross, so today Jews betray the peoples among whom they live as guests. But just as from the Golgotha of the Savior of the world, a resurrection and ascension came, so also will arise from the betrayal and devastation of today an Easter for humanity, because the victory belongs to God in all circumstances.

<p>It is a spiritual battle between the eternal German and the eternal Jew. The essence of the eternal German is rooted in Walddorf; in the value-creating farmer life; the eternal Jew’s only striving is for the department stores and the farmer’s assets. The eternal Jew knows nothing of creative energy. He lacks the moral elevation that is born from the fulfillment of the sunny command of active, value-creating work. He is only a middleman for the sake of his own profit. The eternal German serves himself by serving the community; he has conscience and responsibility. Of such concepts the eternal Jew knows nothing.  His God is his money. Thus he also lacks the capability to build up, to work morally. Since he only knows himself and his physical well-being, he can only destroy. “Revolution is the star of the Jew.” Only the Aryan man, the eternal German, can build up.

<p>It is a remarkable particularity that the eternal German takes on the bad characteristics of the eternal Jew, while we have never once experienced the eternal Jew having taken on the good of the eternal German. Ahasuerus is still today the same as he has been for millennia. Quite naturally: He still knows just one goal, himself, and only one God, money, with which he wants to attain world rule. To transform the world into a unitary Jewish corporation and bring the rest of humanity completely under his rod, is his millennial-long aspiration. For this purpose he makes use of international Freemasonry along with the Socialist worker masses, both of which he leads and rules. World war and world revolution are the final steps in the building of the temple of the eternal Jew. The Antichrist supposes himself already at his goal. But already a voice is resounding: This far and no further! – Has the eternal Jew forgotten that the crucified one arose on the third day from the dead? So he will experience it once again, and soon: Humanity will be resurrected and his power will be shown to be impotence.

<p>It is a spiritual battle that we are experiencing today. It is the Golgotha of the German soul, which will shake off the eternal Jew for all time. Today we are reflecting upon the causes that have plunged us into this unspeakable misery. We recognize the eternal Jew among us as our arch- and sworn-enemy. We were mostly Christians in name only, in reality we long were the eager disciples of the eternal Jew. “Wherein one sins, therein he is punished.” But soon the sleeping giant stretches, the eternal German in us. The German “Michel” with pipe and nightcap wants to become Michael, who with the flaming sword, as God’s hero, will forever drive the fallen Adam, the forefather of the eternal Jew, out of God’s pure Eden.

<p>I am no Jew-persecutor. On the contrary. For is it not regrettable when people perceive their life’s goal only in the temporal? I have always been of the opinion that Jewry is most successfully combatted to the extent one tears everything Jewish out of one’s own soul. For that is indeed the un-Christian in mankind. It is always only the spirit that gives life. And in the end the eternal Jew is only a necessary instrument willed by God for the testing of spirits, the fulfillment of the ages. By the revealing of the impotence and interior rot of his crass Messiah-kingdom, the rule of the golden calf, he becomes the guide who leads humanity to the true Messiah, whose kingdom is not of the world of material, of appearance, of commerce, of acquisition and profit. Thus the eternal Jew is fundamentally a “Servant of God” in the truest sense and is like the “dumb devil” who – as seen in many churches – holds up the holy water basin. Why then persecute the Jews? The further they go, the better for all: then the eyes of every last “Michel” will open up, so that he becomes a “Michael” in the spiritual battle: Christian, behold the Antichrist!

<p>Was Jesus a Jew? We know: it is the spirit that gives life. The spirit of Jesus and the spirit of the Jew – is any greater contradiction imaginable? That is why the Jews indeed showed ill-will toward, persecuted, and drove to a disgraceful death the savior of the world, the “Galilean.” They never counted him among their own, because he was no Jew, neither spiritually nor physically. And today they attack and persecute him again: De-Christianization of the school, separation of Church and State, removal of every Christian concept from civic and public life.

<p>Does one notice that the Antichrist is at work, that this means the final battle? Where will you stand, my dear Christian, when the battle cry goes forth in the spiritual battle? Behold Christian – behold Antichrist?

While a portion of the Czech clergy, as a result of their eager participation in so-called reform efforts, which basically call for undermining of discipline and debilitation of morals, have no time to work against the de-Christianization that is being driven in a determined manner from the top, and the Bishops allow things to go on without saying or doing anything, meanwhile two American-Czech priests have appeared, with the blessing of the Holy Father, who are arousing the faithful people to resistance in huge numbers. The delegation of reformist-oriented priests who went to Rome at the instigation of the Freemasonic Czech Government has meanwhile returned and declared themselves “very satisfied” with the results of their steps in the Vatican; actually they were flatly rebuffed as to all their important issues and are now trying to create the appearance of saving face...

<blockquote>“By their fruits will you know them.”

<p>Whoever believes that Bolshevism is the most ferocious mortal enemy of “capitalism” is indulging in serious self-deception.  In truth it is only a means to hand over that one country that was supposedly ruled up to now by “imperialists” but was actually the freest on earth, to the far worse imperialism of international Freemasonry, ruled by the Jews, and to the “Golden International” whose goal has always been the overthrow of thrones and altars because they are the last bulwarks against the unrestrained deployment of its power. Men who have followed these developments over the decades have brought forward impressive evidence and matters of fact to show that the world war and the world upheaval were only the means to establish the unrestricted world domination of the Golden International, in which universal Jewry plays the leading role. Freemasonry in the Entente countries, and the “Red International,” are completely under Jewish influence. (footnote: see <em>Entente-Freemasonry and the World War</em> by Karl Heise, E. Fürth Publishing House, Basel, 1919, price 9 Francs; <em>World Freemasonry, World Revolution, World Republic</em> by National Councilor Dr. Wichtl, 1919, Lehmann Publishing House, Munich, price 5 Marks; <em>Mazzini, Freemasonry, World Revolution</em> by Herm. Gruber, S.J., Manz Publishing House, Regensburg, 1901, price 4 Marks.) 

<p>Thus the phenomenon that Jews appear everywhere as the leaders, which seems especially strange among the Social Democrats, since it is especially among the Jews that the most “capitalists” are to be found. Whoever is familiar with the nature of Jewry as set forth especially in the Talmud knows that a Jew has only Jewish goals.  Universal Jewry's main goal is world domination; according to the Talmud that is the true Messiah of the Jews.  The means to this end are above all the Freemason lodges of the whole world and the Socialist parties.  “Wherever you look you will find Jews.”

<p>It is precisely Bolshevism that is exclusively the offspring of the Jewish spirit; its fathers and leaders everywhere are Jews (footnote: see <em>Judas Schuldbuch</em> [The Jews' Guilt-Book], by Wilhelm Meister, German <em>Volk</em> Publishing House, Munich, 1919, price 5 Marks, <em>Auf Gut Deutsch</em> [In Plain German], weekly, Munich, Tengstrasse 28.), from Trotsky-Braunstein and Bela Kuhn-Kohn down to the bloody Samueli-Samuel and to the "Noble Anarchist" Erich Mühsam.  Even Lenin, who is always being put forward by the Jews as a non-Jew, is a Semite; he actually is really named Zederblum.

<p>Bolshevism, which is supposed to be the “Dictatorship of the Proletariat,” is nothing more than the dictatorship of a handful of Jews over the Proletariat, with whose help they strive after their secret special goal, the most unrestrained arbitrary, violent dictatorship for their own selfish ends.  The events in Russia and Hungary, and also in Munich, speak an all too distinct idiom.

<p>Certain people speak of Bolshevism as a “sickness” and thus concede to its representatives extenuating circumstances.  In truth Bolshevism is only the open application of Talmudic principles, that is, really Jewish principles. According to the Talmud, which remains today the still binding book of laws of universal Jewry, world domination is the unique duty of the Jews...

<p>Only Aryan innocence, which the Jews concede is a form of “being true to God” and “true faith,” although they nailed the Truth himself to the cross and by their “faith” continually still crucify him, is able to believe that the Jew is really a man like a German or an Italian...

<p>The following facts and considerations show that Bolshevism, plotted by Jews and led by Jews, is actually only a means to the universal Jewish end, an instrument for the establishment of Jewish-capitalist world domination, in order to bow down all the previously free countries of earth under the interest-slavery of capital, which is in the hands of the Jews:

<p>1. From where do the enormous sums originate, with which Bolshevism purchases adherents everywhere? From the Proletarian classes?  No, the supposedly opposing “capitalism” provides them...

<p>2. The fathers and leaders of Bolshevism everywhere are Jews. Jews in Russia, Jews in Hungary, Jews in Bavaria...

<p>3. That Bolshevism is just a massive deception for the benefit of international capitalism is hown by the events in Russia and Hungary...

<p>4. Bolshevik methods, the deliberate, willful destruction of the national economy, is just the means to the particular ends of Jewish capitalism...

<p>5. That Jewish Bolshevism pursues anything but <em>Völkisch</em> goals, is shown by the facts of the “German” Revolution...

<p>Germany, a province of the Jewish world republic, which is pleased to go by the name “League of Nations,” the formerly freest country of the world, is now an interest-slave of Entente-capitalism - these are the glorious "achievements of the Revolution" and of “peace” on the basis of Wilson's 14 points, a peace that was actually prepared for us over the course of decades by the 3 point-brethren of the whole world and universal Jewry. Another “possibility for peace” did not exist at any time during the war.

<a name="20d"></a><p><strong>Sept. 3-4, 1919</strong> Minutes of the Conference of the Bavarian Bishops:

<blockquote>Present: Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Jacobus von Hauck, Archbishop of Bamberg, Antonius von Henle, Bishop of Regensburg, Maximilian von Lingg, Bishop of Augsburg, Leo von Mergel, O.S.B., Bishop of Eichstätt, Sigismund Felix Freiherr von Ow-Felldorf, Bishop of Passau, Ludwig Sebastian, Bishop of Speyer, Cathedral Chapter Member Thaddäus Stahler representing Bishop Ferdinand von Schloer of Würzburg.

<p>First session, Wednesday, September 3, 9:00-1:00. After a Holy Mass of the Holy Spirit in the house chapel, the Archbishop of Munich and Freising greeted, in the great hall of the priest seminary, his most reverend brethren, who had appeared in spite of the great difficulties of travel. Also Bishop Ludwig von Speyer this time had received travel permission from the French occupation for this conference. The horrible peace treaty of June 28, 1919, the publication of the new constitution of the German Reich of August 11, 1919, and the new constitution of August 12, 1919 for the Free State of Bavaria, the Teacher- and Schools-Law, the annulment of Bavaria’s federal state sovereignty and the impact of all these events on the life of the Church have made a joint council of the Bishops urgent...

<p>The agenda, significantly expanded since the first draft of June 21st, is accepted in its new form.

<p>Point I of the agenda: The future relationship between Church and State in Bavaria and the cancellation of the Concordat. Memoranda from Excellencies Jacobus of Bamberg and Antonius of Regensburg. Fundamental are Articles 135-141 of the new Constitution of the German Reich and Sections 17-19 of the new Constitution for the Free State of Bavaria. The conference is of the view, 1) that the Concordat and the Church Community Order in Bavaria still lawfully exist and have not been made invalid either by the Revolution nor by the Reich Constitution nor by individual decrees contrary to the Concordat by the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs, 

<p>2) that the Concordat cannot continue in its old form, if only because the oath of loyalty in Art. XV falls away and Art. 137 of the Reich Constitution guarantees the freedom [for the Church] to appoint to Church offices for Bavaria as well, which was governed by Articles IX-XI of the Concordat, which would be a danger for the discipline of the clergy, a disaster for pastoral care and an intolerable shackle on the freedom of the Church. Excellency von Henle especially pointed out that the Church as instrument of salvation is not mentioned in the Constitution at all, but rather is dealt with only like one of the societies governed under the police power. 

<p>3) For the establishment of the future relationship between Church and State in Bavaria, about which negotiations are to begin soon with the Nunciature, Archbishop Jacobus made several observations at the request of the Apostolic Nunciature. Of the 9-1/2 million Mark annual subsidies that the Bavarian State previously made to the Catholic Church, about 7 million are so-called optional contributions, which must equally be included in the planned removal, because our people, impoverished by the lost war, cannot possibly support such a high level through taxation or voluntary contributions, and because State funds were only a return on secularized property of the Church. The conference looks with great concern upon future appointments to positions of religious instruction and professorships, especially those for philosophy and other ideologically significant subjects.

<p>Point II: Appointments to vacant parish positions.  In Bavaria there are currently 105 parishes and benefices, including 30 to which the Church has right of appointment [liberae collationis], that are being administered by a vicar [i.e., the pastor position is vacant], because since the outbreak of revolution we could not concede to the Socialist Government the vested rights [of appointment etc.] in Article XI of the Concordat; in particular there are in the Augsburg Diocese 21 parishes (including 5 liberae collationis), in Bamberg 12 (7), in Eichstätt 5 (1), in Munich 17 (3), in Passau 8 (2), in Regensburg 17 (2), in Speyer 15 (6), in Würzburg 10 (4). The Archbishop of Munich has repeatedly negotiated with Apostolic Nuncio Pacelli, in view of the harm that such long vacancies increasingly cause for pastoral care, priestly discipline and the economic condition and economy of the parishes, and has prayed the Holy Father for a provisional way to handle this matter. The most recent order from Cardinal Secretary of State Gasparri was: Do not enter into any kind of negotiations with the Government, so as not to jump the gun on the overall Concordat negotiations! Thus for the while we will not negotiate with the Government even about the positions to be appointed by us, until a clear legal situation is created, despite the communication of August 6th, in which the State Government declared itself already prepared to approve the hierarchy’s appointments to benefices and commit to the temporalities thereof, “for tactical reasons,” as the Nuncio said. It is, however, the general desire that negotiations about the dead point get underway as soon as possible and that Art. 137 of the Reich Constitution go into effect as soon as possible in Bavaria as well.

<p>Point III. The Kulturkampf in the realm of the schools; the position of the private school and religious order school in the new school law. Speaker: Bishop Leo of Eichstätt. Of the three major demands that we set forth in our memorandum of May 25, 1919 about the Bavarian school issue, neither the confessional character of the school, nor religion as an obligatory subject, nor the joint oversight right of the Church is established in the new school law. Long discussions about Art. 142-150 of the Reich Constitution and Sections 20-21 of the Bavarian Constitution and about the conduct of the Center Party and the Bavarian People’s Party in these negotiations. With respect to the clause in Art. 149 of the Reich Constitution, that the administration of religious instruction will be governed “in the framework of legislation about schools,” we maintain that hereby all regulations about teaching organs, teaching plans, teaching materials and teaching methods are a matter for the Church. It must be expected of the Bavarian People’s Party that it will uphold the principles and rights of the Church in the upcoming school law, without consideration of gaining political advantages. In the proclamation [by the Bishops], in which some of the conference’s decisions will be shared with the people, there shall be an appeal to Catholic parents to use all lawful means, including participation in the parent associations and written declarations of their desires, to stand up for the confessional school. The unrequested equalizing of the wages of religious order teachers with the minimum wage for secular teachers is in our eyes a Danae-gift.

<p>Second Session: September 3rd, 3-7 p.m.

<p>Point IV: Church and the Teaching Profession. Speaker: His Bishop-Grace Sigismund Felix of Passau.

<p>1) Our demands concerning the religious training and continuing education of candidates for teaching positions were briefly summarized by the speaker (Attachment I) and transmitted by the Archbishop of Munich and delegates Wohlmuth and Eggersdorfer…

<p>Point V: Threatening of the Apostolic Nuncio and other anti-Papal and anti-Church phenomena accompanying the Second Revolution and Third Revolution.

<p>Following the violations of international law against the Nunciature in the Räterepublik era on April 29 and 30, 1919, the Archbishop of Munich  has already verbally expressed his indignation. The official proclamation to the people shall, at least in summary form, take a stance as to this and other events, the ringing of [Church] bells upon the death and cremation of Eisner and upon the Red Army’s nighttime alarms, the forced displaying of flags, the plan to murder Bishop Maximilian of Augsburg, the violation of domestic peace in the form of house arrest of the Archbishops of Bamberg and Munich, the blasphemy in the funeral speech for Eisner, the repeated disturbances of popular missions, the violation of the seal of secrecy for Nunciature mail, the public contempt for Papal couriers, the instigations against the Pope, which arose anew in connection with the Holy Father’s speech about Joan of Arc and the repeal of the Provida, which was disseminated among the people by leaflets.

<p>Point VI: Address to the Holy Father...

<p>Point VII.: Exegesis of some points of Canon Law...

<p>Third Session. September 4, 8:30-12:30.

<p>Point VIII: Association for the Clergy ...

<p>Point IX: Question arising from the Passau Diocesan Synod...

<p>Point X. The ecclesiastical administration of the Saar District...

<p>Point XI. Request of the Diocesan Presidents of the Catholic Male and Female Worker Associations...

<p><strong>Sept. 8, 1919</strong>: Bishops’ Guidelines for the Position and Sphere of Activity of Priests in the Local School Authorities (Addendum 2 to Minutes of the Bavarian Bishops Conference, Sept. 3 and 8, 1919), with Prefatory Comments by Faulhaber:

<blockquote>Prefatory Comments

<p>As to Point IV, Section 2, “Position of the Clergy in the local school authorities,” needs a complete reworking in light of the September 6 publication of the Ministerial Decree of August 28th, which his Episcopal Grace of Passau had the grace to express in a worthy manner, and whose most pressing and unambiguous points are summarized in appendix 2...

<p>A final suggestion of the Most Reverend Herr reporter would well be more discreetly brought by our school deacon rather than by our pastoral letter to the parish leadership, namely: “The clergy might make its influence effective in this direction by seeking to win over community- and district-members to have them influence in a favorable way the election of community representatives, and influence especially representatives of the parents in the bodies attending to the schools and the district bodies attending to the schools, as well as district representatives in the latter bodies.  It will also be possible for the clergy to influence in this sense the members of the district convention, so that also the election of a priest can occur as district representative in the district bodies attending to the schools...

<p>In section 33 a form of religious instruction is decreed that befits the bureaucratic mentality of a real free state: “Governmental school oversight extends to the imparting of religion instruction in the primary schools, insofar as it is an issue of overseeing the conduct of the external school order, school discipline and school visitation. Religion instruction in its content shall be imparted in concordance with the principles of the relevant religious society. The religious societies and their representatives have no official oversight authority with respect to primary school personnel who are involved in imparting religious instruction. They are still at liberty to appeal to the official oversight authorities whenever complaints are to be raised.” Should an unwarranted meddling in this direction by governmental oversight organs come to pass, going beyond school order and school policing, and in particular should there be an effort to leave it to any other than Church authority to judge whether the content of religious instruction comports with Catholic principles, it would have to be reported to immediately.

<p>In holding ourselves back from anything further, we exhort our reverend clergy to bring even this limited remaining influence to bear conscientiously, as members of the bodies attending to the schools, by making appropriate contributions, for example, providing Biblical images and other ways of presenting religious viewpoints, or making available school venues for in the event that, for lack of time or teaching resources, some instruction groups must be formed by combining several school sections … Above all, however, he will care for and build up parent association in such a way that it will create and preserve a reliable support structure for his efforts of pastoral care as well as the desires and requirements of the Church with respect to the parents who are represented in the bodies attending to the schools and the district bodies attending to the schools.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sept. 4, 1919</strong> Bishops’ Guidelines for a Priests’ Professional Association (Addendum 5 to Minutes of the Bavarian Bishops Conference)

<blockquote>1) A new professional association for priests, which follows professional and ecclesiastical purposes in the way of a union, and which follows the lines of a lay professional organization, stands in its essence in contradiction with the old Christian as well as the newly established Church constitution as set down in Book II of the Code of Canon Law, in contradiction with the clear words of Pope Pius X in the Encyclica Pascendi and with the clear instruction of Pope Benedict XV to the Hungarian Bishops [of March 12, 1919].  Efforts in this direction are a disrespect of the immutable hierarchical character of the Church of Christ, which at no time tolerates a reforming in more or less parliamentary or democratic forms. The good intentions of its spokesmen should not be brought into question; many recommendations such a those for the introduction of a priestly property society arise from absolutely ideal priestly viewpoints. For the priestly class, however, the rights to associations and assemblies are under special laws, similar to those according to Canon 1386 section 1 in which the publishing activity of clergy is subjected to stricter measures than for lay persons; similar to those for Diocesan synods, whose decisions can only take effect by the Bishop’s approval, while a different order applies to lay assemblies.

<p>2) Permissible and compatible with Canon Law are those professional associations of clerics that are established for academic, charitable, ascetic, or educational purposes, also those for economic purposes, like the Pax-Association with its rights-defense-authority and its security measures  or the economy-pastors-league in Bavaria.

<p>3)   A professional association of Catholic priests extending over all Bavaria or indeed over all Germany, which to the delight of the Church’s enemies is advocated by some officious newspapers, is rejected by the Bishops Conference for the above-stated reasons and because it violates the organic constitution of the Dioceses. On the other hand, no general Church law stands in the way if, with the approval of the Bishop, a Diocesan association should be founded for the protection of economic interests of the clergy as a class, in order to make up in some ways for any falling off of the former State subsidies. 

<p>4) An accessible way to clarify these efforts is envisioned by the Conference in the working group with the school association of Catholic priests, whose previous field of activity (securing the Christian school) being expanded for this purpose, for the furtherance of the economic interests of the clergy and the future handling of this matter will be directed namely by including it in the Diaconate constitution.</blockquote>

<a name="22"></a><p><strong>Sept. 16, 1919</strong> Hitler’s first documented antisemitic statement, in a letter to a Herr Gemlich:

<blockquote>Honorable Herr Gemlich,
   
<p>If the danger posed by Jewry today for our people finds its expression in an undeniable aversion among the great part of our people, then the cause of this aversion is not generally to be found in a clear recognition of the systematic – whether recognized or not – pernicious effect of the Jews as a whole upon our nation, but rather it arises generally from personal interactions which leave an almost universally unfavorable impression, made by each individual Jew.  For this reason, antisemitism is too easily seen as a mere emotional phenomenon. And yet this is incorrect.  Antisemitism as a political movement may not and cannot be defined in terms of impulses of emotion, but rather in terms of recognition of facts.  And the facts are:  First, Jewry is absolutely a race and not a membership in a religion.  And the Jews themselves never characterize each other as Jewish Germans, Jewish Poles, or Jewish Americans, but always as German, Polish, or American Jews.  Never yet have the Jews adopted much more than the language of the foreign peoples among whom they live.  Just as a German who necessarily makes use of the French language in France, Italian in Italy, and Chinese in China, does not thereby become a Frenchman, an Italian, or a Chinaman, in the same way one cannot say that a Jew who is living among us and necessarily making use of the German language, thereby becomes a German.  And even the Mosaic faith, so important for the survival of this race, does not exclusively settle the issue of whether one is a Jew or a non-Jew. There is hardly a race whose members belong without exception to one single certain religion. 
 
  <p>Through thousands of years of inbreeding, universally practiced within the narrowest circles, the Jew has generally preserved his race and its peculiarities more distinctly than numerous peoples among whom he has lived.  And thus arises the fact that a non-German foreign race lives among us, unwilling and unable to give up its racial peculiarities or to disown its sentiments, thoughts, and strivings, and yet it possesses all the same political rights as we ourselves.  If the sentiments of the Jew bestir themselves only in the purely material realm, how much more so his thoughts and strivings.  The dance around the golden calf becomes a merciless struggle for all those possessions which, according to our own inner sentiments, should not be the highest focus of our efforts here on this earth.

   <p>The worth of the individual is no longer determined by his character or by the significance of his accomplishments for the common good, but rather exclusively by the size of his fortune, by his money. 

   <p>The loftiness of the nation is no longer measured by the sum of its moral and spiritual strengths, but rather by the wealth of its material possessions. 

   <p>From this sentiment arises that thinking and striving after money and power, which enables the Jew to remain unscrupulous in the choice of means, and pitiless in their employment toward this end.  In an autocratically governed state he whines for the favor of “His Majesty” the prince, and misuses that favor as a leech on the prince’s people.  In a democracy he strives for the favor of the masses, fawns before the “majesty of the people,” and yet knows only the majesty of money. 

   <p>He destroys the character of the prince by byzantine flattery and destroys national pride, the strength of a people, by ridicule and shameless training in depravity.  His method of battle employs that form of public opinion which is never explicitly printed in the press but which is nonetheless always furthered and twisted by the press.  His power is the power of money, which increases in his hands effortlessly and endlessly in the form of interest, and which forces upon peoples this most dangerous of yokes, whose initially attractive golden glitter makes it so difficult to recognize its later tragic consequences.  Everything mankind strives for in the higher realm, be it religion, socialism, democracy, is to him only a means to the end of satisfying his lust for gold and power. 

   <p>His impact becomes, consequentially, a racial tuberculosis among peoples. 

   <p>And from that arises the following:  An antisemitism based on purely emotional grounds will find its ultimate expression in the form of pogroms.  An antisemitism based on reason, however, must lead to systematic combat by lawful means and the setting aside of the privileges of the Jew, which he possesses in contrast to other foreigners living among us (legislation concerning aliens). The ultimate objective of such legislation absolutely must be, permanently, the complete removal of the Jews.   

   <p>What can serve these purposes is only a government of national strength and never a government of national weakness.

   <p>The Republic in Germany owes its birth not to the general national will of our people but to the sly exploitation of a chain of circumstances which together resulted in a state of deep universal dissatisfaction.  These circumstances, however, were independent of the form of government and are still working their effect today.  Indeed, more today than before. That is why the great part of our people fully recognizes that our situation cannot be changed and improved simply by a change in the form of government, but only by a rebirth of the moral and spiritual strengths of the nation. 

   <p>And this rebirth will not be brought about by government leaders of irresponsible majorities under the influence of certain party dogmas, by an irresponsible press, by phrases and slogans of an internationalist stamp, but only by the ruthless installation of nationalist-minded leader personalities [<em>nationalgesinnte Führerpersonlichkeiten</em>] with an inner sense of responsibility. 

   <p>This fact is still robbing the Republic of the inner support of the spiritual strengths that are so utterly essential to the nation.  And so today’s government leaders are forced to seek support among those who drew and are drawing the exclusive benefits from the new order of German governmental arrangements, and who for this reason were really the driving force of the Revolution: the Jews.  Heedless of the well-established danger posed by Jewry, which is well known also to today’s leaders (as shown by various statements of leading figures of the day), they were forced to accept the support willingly proffered by the self-interested Jews, and then came through with the required quid pro quo. And this payoff consisted not only in every possible furthering of Jewry, but above all in obstructing the struggle of the defrauded people against their defrauders, by neutralizing the antisemitic movement.

<p>Letter to a Magistrate in the City of Linz, Austria, Jan. 21, 1914, from Munich:

<blockquote>Magistrate Linz Div. II

<p>On Sunday the 18th a 3:30 p.m. I received a summons to an interview via the criminal-sheriff Herle, assigned to Rottmann Street 14/Div. II, according to which I must report for an interview in Linz on the 20th, otherwise I would be dealt with under sections 64 and 66 of the Defense Act [i.e. prosecuted for evading the draft in Austria] ...

<p>Since on Sundays everything is closed, and on Monday as the weekday following any non-workday, generally throughout Germany businesses come open only at 9 a.m. and offices however (also such as government offices) only at 10 a.m., I however would have had to depart, at the latest, right after Noon, so I would have hardly had time for the most basic bodily ablutions, like taking a bath.

<p>The main reason, however, that made it impossible for me to comply with the summons was that I could not succeed within such a short period, amounting to hardly 6 hours, in coming up with even the bare amount of money necessary for the trip.

<p>I was identified in the summons as a painter-artist.  If I rightly bear such a title, it is only really however in a qualified sense.  My earnings as an independent painter-artist are just barely enough, since I am entirely without means (my father was a civil servant), to enable my further training...

<p>I offer as proof of this my tax return and request ... advice and at the suggestion of the Consular officer I sent the telegram with a request for a postponement.  I only received notice of the negative reply for the first time today, the 21st, at 9 a.m.

<p>There is also in all this certainly some guilt on my part.  I neglected to report in Fall 1909; however tried to make up for this in February 1910.  At that time I reported in Vienna at the Conscription I(B) office at the City Hall and was then directed to the 20th District as my district of residence.  I asked to be allowed to be stationed in Vienna, had to sign a record or application and pay one crown, and then heard nothing more at all about it.  It could never however have been my intention to escape from this … I was always on the records in Vienna and am equally so here, and am moreover in contact with the District Court in Linz, my original authority.  My address was thus already always in this way easy to learn...

<p>I send this writing separately from the one I likewise signed today at the Consulate as a record.  I also ask that I be allowed further opportunity through the Consulate, and I ask in the assurance that I will not delay in the punctual compliance with it...</blockquote>

<p>Letter to Anna Popp [his landlady while living in Munich before the war], Oct. 20, 1914, from Graben/Lechfeld:

<blockquote>Dear Frau Popp,

<p>Please excuse me for only now writing for the first time.  But it is really only now that there is time.  As I told you we left Munich on Saturday.  From 6:30 in the morning until 5 in the evening we were on our feet, in a big maneuver, all in the pouring rain.  In Alling we had makeshift quarters.  I was billeted in a shed, soaked through and through.  Of sleep there was naturally none to speak of.  Sunday we continued from 5 in the morning until 6 in the evening, everyone tired to death, from one maneuver to another.  Around 6pm it was “bivouac in the open.”  The night was bitter cold, and again we didn’t sleep.  Monday was more marching from 5 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon.
    
<p>We were dead tired and collapsing at the end of the march, not so much from the marching as much more from the unaccustomed backpacks.  Around 1:00 in the afternoon we marched through the French [prisoner of war] camp at Lechfeld.  We were greatly astonished.  The chaps hardly imagined we had so many troops.  Moreover there were mostly very strong figures to see.  These were really French elite troops who were taken prisoner at the beginning of the campaign.  Despite exhaustion we were rigidly marched right through.  These were the first Frenchmen I ever saw in my life.  The first 5 days in Lechfeld were the toughest of my life.  Every day a long march, big maneuvers, and night marches as long as 42 kms, combined with big maneuvers with the brigade.  The only good thing was the billeting.  We had private quarters with rations in the on-site trenches.  The rations were especially first-rate.  They stuffed us all-out.  We had two full days of rest.  Today, the 20th, in the evening, we started on a four-day train trip to the front, apparently to Belgium.  I am absolutely delighted.  Sunday was still the consecration of flags.  We received 6 new flags and our first company were flag-bearers for the whole brigade.  After we arrive at our appointed destination I will immediately write and provide my address.  I hope we come to England.  How are you and your husband, Mrs. Popp?  

<p>In the meantime all my greetings to you and your husband and your children Peppi and Liesel from your devoted Adolf Hitler.

<p>I will still sketch in detail for Herr Popp my first impressions once I am in enemy country, and again all my greetings.</blockquote>

<p>Letter to Joseph Popp [landlord], from the Western Front, Dec. 3, 1914:

<blockquote>Dear Herr Popp,

<p>I ask you most sincerely to excuse me for letting so much time pass without being heard from.  The reason for this I want to give later.  Thank you very much for the dear words you wrote me.  My statement that we would come to Antwerp was not fulfilled.  After a very beautiful trip along the Rhine, we traveled then for 22 nights through Belgium.  As we left Aachen we were again, as often during the whole trip, greeted enthusiastically by thousands, and at 9 o’clock we came to Lüttich.  The train station was completely closed.  The traffic was enormous.  Naturally just military.  Around midnight we came to Löwen.  The city is just a pile of rubble.  Through Brussels we then traveled to Tournai and arrived on the next day around 5 o’clock in Lille.  There we were at general quarters for three days.  In Tournai we had already heard continuous distant cannon fire, and in Lille the rollcall seemed to go on endlessly.  Lille is a real French major city.  Individual sectors of it had been fired upon by us and burned down.  By and large, however, the city has suffered little.  In Lille, as I mentioned, we had nothing but general quarters.  On the night of the 27th at 1 a.m. an alarm sounded suddenly and we marched out at 2 in a general march, and on the morning of the 29th at 7 o’clock we came into the battle and really right in the foremost front for attack.  This was the battle of Geluwe and Bezelaere.  For 4 days we were in the heaviest fighting and with pride may I say that our Regiment fought heroically and already by evening of the first day we had lost nearly all our officers and our company had only ... staff sergeants remaining.  By the fourth day our Regiment from a strength of 3600 men had only 611 men remaining.  But we had slaughtered the English.  I became Lance Corporal [<em>Gefreiter</em>] and remained unharmed as by a miracle, after three days of rest we went forward again and fought at Messines and then at Wytschaete.  There we did two more attacks.  But it went yet even harder.  My Company has now only 42 men and the 11th Company has only 17.  Now we have received three reinforcement transfers totaling 1200 men all together.  I myself have already been recommended for the Iron Cross after the second battle.  But the Company Commander was yet seriously wounded on the same day and the matter went dormant.  So I came into a staff position as Combat Runner.  Since then, might I say, I have really put my life on the line every day and looked death in the eye.  Lieutenant Colonel Engelhardt himself then recommended me for the Iron Cross.  But he too was seriously wounded the same day.  That was already our second Regimental Commander, for the first had already fallen on the third day.  Now I was once again recommended by Adjutant Eichelsdörfer and yesterday December 2nd I really received the Iron Cross.  It was the happiest day of my life.  Certainly my comrades who had deserved it also were almost all dead.  I ask you, dear Mr. Popp, to hold onto the newspaper in which my commendation appears.  I would like to keep it as a remembrance, if the Lord God allows me life.  And now, dear Mr. Popp, how are you and your family?  Hopefully all in good health.  It is an absolute miracle that nothing at all is ailing me despite the enormous exertions and lack of sleep.  What are Peppi and Liesel doing?  I think very often of Munich and especially of you, dear Mr. Popp, and your wife.  Sometimes I still have strong homesickness.  I am signing off now, dear Mr. Popp, and ask once again to excuse my not writing for so long.  The reason for it was the Iron Cross.  My address is now just

<blockquote>On the occasion of a very nice, clear and emotional lecture by Lance Corporal Hitler about capitalism, which touched thereby upon the Jewish question, really had to touch on it, arose concerning the ways and means for the occasion of a speaking detachment, with various points of view about whether one should express his opinions in a clear and unvarnished manner or in a rather veiled form.  It was arranged that the detachment would be assigned to Möhl’s Group Command and conduct its own mission.  If the Jewish question were presented now in entirely clear form with special consideration of the German standpoint, this type of expression could easily give the Jews occasion to label the lectures as Jew-baiting.  Therefore I saw myself authorized to arrange that the treatment of this question should be handled in the most careful way possible and that overly clear references to this race that is foreign to the German people are to be avoided as far as possible.</blockquote><br>

<p>Nov. 13, 1919, “Brest-Litovsk and Versailles,” speech to a German Workers Party meeting:

<blockquote>These same rulers, the speaker amplified, who previously declared they were indifferent how the war would be ended, now declare the war is the reason for all the misery.  Instead of agreement there is deception, instead of reconciliation everything is a matter of power.  There are drastic differences between the two peace agreements.  Brest-Litovsk is called a shameful peace, but a comparison makes it obvious how different they are.  The ceasefire of Spa was made for 21 days and extensions were provided for; our ceasefire was made for 30 days and each extension had to be begged for.

<p>The first bill the Entente presented to us came to 3 billion.  In the following days a couple hotels in Munich were commandeered for the oversight commission; we have to feed the snitches, and in Berlin there are already 1000 of them.  We have to maintain a professional army (with 12-year enlistments); our current 100,000 men cost us as much as our 500,000 did previously, namely 1 billion 800 million (outcry:  Read the “Kampf,” the Jews and the Independent Social Democrats are the greatest snitches in the whole country).  But it’s not enough that our adversaries want our weapons, they demand also our spirits.  In the whole history of the world, no people has ever been forced to declare itself ready to sign such a shameful treaty (Jew-powers).  They call it a free state, meaning all are free, while everything is swindle, fraud, they are not even ashamed any more to allow further immigration of Jews.  We want to be a free people and not a free state (rousing applause).  We must fight for the idea that it cannot keep going on like this.  German misery must be broken by German iron.  This time must come...

<p><em>Münchener Beobachter</em> newpaper’s report on the same speech:

<blockquote>... The speaker presented in a most skillful manner the contrast between the majority of the German (sic ?) press calling the Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk shameful and forced, and the same press, in a deceitful and bloody-minded manner, calling Versailles a negotiated peace.  The images that Herr Hitler developed of the two peace treaties brought them into flagrant contrast for perceptive listeners, and roused many hearts into a passion.  Outcries of approval signaled the agreement of the listeners with the expression of the exceptionally high-spirited remarks of the speaker.  The lecturer encountered enthusiastic agreement when he identified the republic as a free state of the Entente whose freedom within its borders consists in the license of Volks-plunderers, usurers, exploiters and black-marketeers to oppress the Volk in the most vulgar manner with impunity.  Uproarious applause, continuing on and on, returned thanks for the worthy remarks of Herr Hitler.

<p>Nov. 26, 1919, contribution to a discussion at a German Workers Party meeting:

<blockquote>... Much criticism.  All the promises, not only those made before the war, but also those which were made in the manifesto of November 15th, have been completely unfulfilled.  Civil war has actually arrived.  Every day we are pressed harder (savings premiums – bonds).  The farmers will provide us with food, in a few days everything will go according to plan (don’t laugh).  That is how we were swindled 12 months ago.  Amazing powers!  Yes, in any event, they have no respect of governments.  Ceasefire provisions will be adjusted.  Yes, yes, a few days ago they received the proof.</blockquote>

<p>With 2, then 7, then 9 men we have begun the work.  The Party grows from day to day, and it will not give up the fight, it will never do that.  We fight against money.  Only work, not money, will help us.  The bondage to interest must be broken.  We fight against the races that are the representatives of money.  Character has meaning in the face of this money.

<p>We call ourselves a German Party, because we want to be German and lead the struggle against the Polish-Jewish mob.

<p>The cabinet posts cannot be occupied by incompetents, we want experts.  We want a German <em>Volk</em>.  We are a reactionary party and we show this in that we fight against the Jews, lay a firm grip on them.  Schiller said: What human hands build, human hands can also destroy.  We want to be a free <em>Volk</em> in a free Germany!

<blockquote>The worst scoundrel is not the Jew, but the one who places himself at the disposal of the Jews (applause).  We fight against the Jew because he obstructs the battle against capitalism.  We have brought our bitter distress upon ourselves.  Now that the whole world is against us, we are still fighting each other domestically.  So in whose interest is it that we fight each other?  We already know.  Now he [the speaker] turns against the German Federation.  He appeals for a good turnout at the assembling this coming Friday of the German Federation at the Wagner Hotel.

<p>Jan. 16, 1920, contribution to a discussion about a German Workers Party meeting: 

<blockquote>Anton Drexler presided over the meeting of 400 persons ...
<p>Hitler must admit that no talk has pleased him like that of the proletariat.  From them rings out the conviction that what we want to do, break the power of the Jews, is also right for them.  They take no notice of a peace treaty.  They say to the worker:  You must increase your income, no one thinks about sufficiency.  They don’t say to him that with an increase of income there will also be an increase in expenses.  Taxes must go away, rents must go away, then the lowering of prices will follow of its own accord and every individual can live better.
   
<p>The implementation of improvement is only possible by political means.  The breaking of interest slavery will take a major fight.  In unity there is strength.  Now the monstrosity of fulfillment of the peace terms is beginning.  We demand struggle against the peace treaty.  Or do you believe that France, even if a new government came to power, would waive their fulfillment?  Every drop of sweat that flows from our brow flows not for us but for our adversaries.  One people has a right to live, another people must starve.  We demand the re-establishment of our financial condition.  We will not stand for our fate being governed by people of a foreign race.  We demand that the immigration of Jews be forbidden.  We fight against the Jew because he is not a German, because he is the protector of big capital.  Today his wheat is growing better than ever.  The Communists do not recognize that they are serving big capital.  They rattle off phrases and catchwords until they can spout them right back.  The Jews are inundating our country with brochures.  You can’t recognize yourself any more for all the clear principles etc.  But the day will come when the workers open their eyes, and then the leaders will be chased to the devil.  We want to have the workers behind us, that is why we are a Workers Party.

<p>Feb. 24, 1920, speech at the inaugural meeting of the National Socialist German Workers Party at the Hofbräuhaus Beer Hall in Munich:

<blockquote>Police reporting service – in the Festival Hall of the Hofbräuhaus:

<p>... He thanks the opposition, who were present in large numbers, for their peaceful conduct and says that “we won’t stab them in the back.”  Now he sets out clearly what the German Workers Party wants.  Everywhere there is distress, misery, hunger, etc.  How long can this go on, everyone asks themselves, and what is being done officially against it?  Nothing!  Because the government is too cowardly to tell the people the truth (lively applause and handclapping).  We keep hearing only one thing:  Work more!  But there they forget to say that every bit of additional work goes to benefit not ourselves but our enemies.  By this peace treaty, continually new, enormous sufferings are brought forth.  Week by week billions in new paper money are printed, which continually lowers the value of the money.  There was a time when our officials were famous for their reliability and incorruptibility.  And today?  How can we expect honor from this class when the highest ranking is named Herr “Erzberger”?  (thunderous applause)  The Democratic Party has declared that it will not go well if Herr Erzberger remains in office longer. They should have meant:  We find it inconceivable that this Herr is not yet sitting in prison (lively applause). Through these bad examples corruption has multiplied...

<p>The workers are always being told they should emigrate to Russia.  Wouldn’t it be more to the purpose if then the Eastern Jews stayed put, if there is really so much work there? (lively applause) You can well imagine what kind of work is there, if they move here (applause) (Down with the Jewish press!  Out with them!)   Among the criminal elements of racketeers and profiteers, monetary fines have no effect (Flog them!  Hang them!)  How are we going to protect our fellow men from this band of leeches?  (Hang them!)  No doubt we are good theoreticians, but we are not good practitioners.  We must learn over and again that our existence is bound to the entirety of the <em>Volk</em>.  Our <em>Volk</em> are always hoping for the solidarity of the entire world, but there is one thing not hoped for: Our own solidarity (applause).  This should be said to the international workers:  Whoever relies on others is lost!  (thunderous applause)  We amuse ourselves and dance in order to forget our misery.  It is not a coincidence that ever more new pleasures are being found.  They really will artificially enervate us (applause).  On the one hand it is said: You should work, on the other hand: nothing but pleasure! Our political parties have the mission to better enlighten the <em>Volk</em>.  It hasn’t happened!  Today these parties are unfruitful.  Every party only makes promises (he touches on the USPD).  It prepares one for heaven.  (Schwarrn!)  Look at the DNVP  (Great unrest in the room)!  Then Herr Hitler read off the program of the German Workers Party, whose individual points often evoked loud applause (Lays it on).  During the reading of the program there often came interruptions from the opposition, followed by cries of “Get out.”  There often prevailed such a tumult that I often thought at any moment things would come to blows.  If we do not step any more out in public, that is not cowardice, rather it is from lack of money. Our party is based on the cooperation of all working classes.  Our word means only struggle.  We will walk our path straight and unshakably to our goal (prolonged thunderous applause).  Then the presider read aloud a resolution, in which the sharpest protest was raised against the directing of 4,000,000 pounds of wheat flour to the Jewish community, while thousands received no sick rations.</blockquote> 

<p>Also reported in the <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>, Feb. 28, 1920: ... Herr Hitler (German Workers Party) developed some striking political images, which met with tempestuous applause, but also occasioned contradictions from “prejudiced” adversaries who were present in large numbers; and he gave an overview of the Party Program, which comes close to the program of the German Socialist Party in its main features.

<p>March 1, 1920, letter to Walter Riehl, from Munich:

<blockquote>Honorable Herr Dr. Riehl,

<p>Although we must assume that the letter of 6 February 1920 that you had the kindness to send to us, actually arrived at the wrong address, we must nevertheless provide you an answer, at least to make clear to you, so far as generally is possible in the space of such a short letter, our position on the points that you touch upon in your present writing to us, and which appear to us especially urgent and important.

<p>The attached program of our Party will quickly show you that we, perhaps in contrast to the German-Socialist Party, place the greatest weight on the complete unity of all Germanic peoples, regardless of their former nation-state-affiliation.

<p>We cannot think of any other goal that could possibly be suited to satisfy us interiorly, if not the goal of giving the German <em>Volk</em> the position on this earth appropriate to the strength of its numbers and its culture.  And this goal does not appear to us to be attainable unless the division of the Germanic peoples is brought to an end and our <em>Volk</em> is unified.

<p>For discussions in this field the first person who would come into consideration for our part is Herr Adolf Hitler, who is a co-signer of this letter and who himself is a native German-Austrian.  Herr Hitler is the publicity director of our local Party group. 

<p>As for the other points in your letter, we are under no delusion that any sort of lasting unification of our <em>Volk</em> is possible without providing for an unconditionally recognized focal point for the entire organization and government of the Reich.

<p>The errors and the dark side of Berlin appear to us to be not unrelated to that city and its character, and actually are just the inevitable result of a so-called culture that by its nature is not really determined by influences of a German racial sort, but rather Jewish ones.  It is only natural that in the largest city of the Reich the curse of this sick culture necessarily becomes the most destructive, whether that city is called Berlin or something else.

<p>Therefore <em>our struggle cannot apply only to that city</em>, but to all the causes of our condition.  They consider the so-called “struggle against Berlin” to be a mask for the goal of dragging Germany back into its powerlessness and division via the political setting aside of the Reich capital city, and via the creation of an even larger, set up against it as an ever stronger rival, to leave warring individual states bleeding in a state of perpetual civil war.

<p>We must absolutely reject the creation of a second East-Rome [as Constantinople was set up as a second capital city of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century A.D.]

<p>Moreover we insist to you here in conclusion yet again that <em>our Fatherland is not named Prussia</em> and is not named <em>Bavaria</em>, nor <em>Austria</em>, nor <em>Saxony</em>, but <em>Germany</em>.

<p>Anticipating your response, we sign respectfully, A. Hitler and A. Drexler

<p>March 4, 1920, speech on “The Truth About the ‘Dictated Peace of Brest-Litovsk’ and the So-Called ‘Treaty of Reconciliation and Understanding’ of Versailles,” delivered to a Nazi Party meeting in the Festival Hall of the Hofbräuhaus, Munich:

<blockquote>Hitler begins to speak: 4 opponents in the war made peace with us.  We Germans, for the most part honorable and generous-minded, believed the promises of Wilson about a peace of reconciliation and were so bitterly disappointed.  Instead of reconciliation – deception, instead of agreement – power.  Compare: The armistice concluded by us at Brest-Litovsk (barely three out of a thousand Germans know about it) (great applause) with the one dictated to us at Spa and Versailles.

<p>. . . [here follows a point-by-point comparison, showing that Germany was less harsh on the Russians in the peace agreement of Brest-Litovsk, than the US, England, France and Italy were with the Germans in the treaty of Versailles]

<p>... All the necessities of life have been taken from us, and now we are handed over yet further to our own leaders.  Hitler explains: 

<p>Not because the leaders are a Hindenburg, or a Ludendorff, or a Communist, etc., do I resist with all my strength, but because these are members of the German <em>Volk</em> (Great unrest.  Several Communists who interrupted were ejected by the Reich Army, which had 50 men present)  How can this mob dare to bring anyone before a court that has been put together by such jerks.  (Outcry: It serves them right if they are thrown out!) (Disturbance)  

<p>... If we protect ourselves against this shameful peace, they say the reactionaries are marching.  We protest against a government that degenerates its own <em>Volk</em>, against the dictatorship by that race which has brought all this misery upon us.  Therefore we fight.  We consider this fight to be honorable.  Today we declare: the peace treaty of Versailles must disappear (enormous applause and uproar)  Now we want are going to vote on three points of our program:

<blockquote>1. We demand renegotiation of the peace treaty.

<p>2. We demand capital punishment for all usurers and racketeers of whatever class.

<p>3. We demand a free German Reich.</blockquote>

<p>Unanimously approved.  When the nays were called for, the numerous Communists in the hall didn’t make a move.  No one raised his hand.  (Great uproar, Outcries: Cowards etc.)  Hitler closed to enormous applause.  Then a discussion began, amidst great uproar.

<p>Hitler had the final word and enthusiastically urged joining the German Workers Party.

<p>April 6, 1920, contribution to a discussion on a Nazi Party meeting, as reported by the Munich Police reporting service:

<blockquote>The Jewish question is not easily answered or shrugged off, as for example the “Kampf” or the “Munich Post” would do (applause).  The struggle against Jewry will go on as long as Jewry exists (applause).  He [Hitler] rounded now sharply upon Jewry in a witty manner and thereby won strong applause.

<p>Then he came to the various proclamations of the revolutionary government and the outcries etc. in the Jewish etc. press, and read from some of them outloud, including from the time of the Councils government in Bavaria...

<p>The speaker then added this question to it: OK, where are and remain these nice promises?  We are today much worse off than ever (applause).  Our government has empowered, and still does, corruption, swindling and deception, instead of fighting against it (lively applause).  Didn’t we used to have such outstanding administrators and such dutiful officials? (applause)  And how is it today?  Where in the world is the legendarily incorruptible, dutiful German civil service?  Is it any wonder that officials are no longer what they were, when they see all around them the filthy immigrant East-Jews who line their pockets in the most shameless way, when their chiefs themselves are the greatest of racketeers? (lively applause)  Of the many provisions that are brought into Berlin, for example, the worker sees and touches nothing, and neither does the small official.

<p>Then he came to speak about the Eastern Jews and turned with sharp words against them and demanded their immediate eviction (lively applause).

<p>So then Herr Hitler read aloud the public letter of the League of Jewish Combat Veterans [Frontsoldaten] to the Bavarian government (see Munich Latest News 6 Apr 1920) and was interrupted repeated by cries such as “shameless cheekiness” “herd of pigs” etc.  I spoke about particular aspects and objected to the name Jewish <em>Front</em> Soldiers.  He himself was a simple man for 4-1/2 years with the 16th Reserve Infantry Regiment at the foremost Front, but the Jews in his Regiment he could count on the fingers of one hand...

<p>We do not want to be emotional antisemites who want to produce pogroms, but we are motivated by the relentless determination to take this evil by the root and pull it out root and branch (lively applause).  To accomplish our goal, every means is right for us, even if we have to ally ourselves with the devil (applause).

<p>... So then he read aloud several points (primarily about the eviction of the Eastern Jews and a ban on further immigration), which were then approved unanimously by the meeting.</blockquote>

<p>April 9, 1920, concluding words at a Nazi Party meeting, by Hitler, in the Festival Hall of the Hofbräuhaus, Munich, as reported by the Munich Police reporting service:

<blockquote>... breaking the yoke of interest bondage ... our government is not directed by the German will, but by Jewish money (thunderous Bravos and handclapping)... We want to become once again a united German <em>Volk</em>, even if the whole Jewish mob opposes it (lively applause).  We Bavarians want to save Germany from a difficult hour (applause).  With faith in the greatness of Germany Herr Hitler concluded his remarks.

<p>April 17, 1920, “The World War and its Makers”:

<blockquote>He first offered up the question why the struggles among peoples are not resolved in the realm of law and added a lengthy reflection on law in relation to the various countries. He asked whether it is “lawful” that particular small peoples rule entire parts of the earth.  Examples like England and China (Opium War), England and Italy, England and the Boers shed light on the question of law.  So then the speaker came to speak about our opponents.  He divides these into two groups.  The first group comprises those who recently in the course of time have become our enemies for one reason or another; the second, those who a long time ago were our enemies.  He began with Russia and touched upon its Asian policy of conquest.  He maintains that between us and Russia an agreement cannot take place because the international Jewish press has prevented it (applause).  So then he spoke about Romania and Serbia, which turned against Austria-Hungary and thereby also against us.  Italy strove to dominate the Mediterranean, etc.  France has long pursued the destruction of Germany, no matter what the government of Germany might be at the time.  It is filled with blind hatred and desire for revenge.  France drives international policy.  Bismarck, the greatest German statesman, recognized all of this and set his policy accordingly.  The speaker dealt with England at somewhat greater length.  England with its few million rules practically one-fifth of the entire earth.  The English fleets!  English colonial power, the greatest in the world!  England controls world commerce.  How then could England generally attain to such power?

<blockquote>1. Through British nationalist sentiment, which is so lacking among our <em>Volk</em> (absolutely right!);

<p>2. Through racial purity in the colonies.  The Englishman has always known to act only as lord and not brother.

<p>3. Through his extraordinary ingenuity.  He could always take commercial power into his own hands.  The Englishman has a masterful understanding of how to turn his enemies, once he has conquered them, into allies, and then to go on with them to conquer new lands.</blockquote>

<p>The speaker gave some examples.  English merchants and engineers etc. were at the forefront of the whole world.  While England was exporting goods, we were exporting people.  Our emigrants were only working slaves, they were artificial manure for the peoples (applause).  Recently it has become entirely different.  The Germans gave the English stiff competition.  German engineers pressed hard upon England’s.  We began also to export goods, while we still – after the glorious revolution – still produced human exports, but only for Germans (spirited/lively applause).  The speaker then came to the Road to Baghdad, the German colonies etc., and sang a song of praise to German diligence and German honesty and solidity.  It would have taken only a few more years and Germany would have become the leading commercial state of the world.  England recognized that and directed its policy accordingly.  First they tried economic measures like tariffs, labels on German goods saying Made in Germany, etc., to wrestle Germany to the ground.  But they did not succeed.  After that time hatred against us grew immeasurably, and England started to think of annihilating us by war.  English encirclement policy!

  <p>The speaker then spoke of America and alluded to the U-Boat campaign, which he did not consider the sole cause of bringing America into the war.  He went on to make comparisons between the Germany of earlier times, renowned for honesty and solidity and the Germany of today, which resembles a pile of rubble (lively applause)...

<p>... Who is it that directed German policy during the last years before the war? (Jews!) They were not all-German, they were all-Jewish!  (thunderous applause)  While we had to endure 4-1/2 long years of need and deprivation and fear of death, thousands who stayed home sought to enrich themselves in the most unscrupulous ways and to systematically undermine the German <em>Volk</em> internally (lively applause).  

<p>... We want to remain faithful to our German <em>Volk</em> (applause).  First and foremost we are Germans and only then, God knows, can we be something in addition (lively applause).  We must get rid of the poison within us and outside us if we want to get well (applause).  Only through work can we rise up again.  We have greater respect for the worker with the calloused hand than for the white collar worker with the furrowed brow! (lively applause)  In this sense we are National Socialists.

<p>Then the speaker exhorted people to become members of the Workers Party and closed with the words: “There will yet come a day when the sun again breaks through” (prolonged thunderous applause).</blockquote>


<p>Report in “Der Kampf” of April 20, 1920:

<blockquote>... He complained that the world is so unfairly divided up, and urgently called for a more just division according to the proposals of Ludendorff and companions.  The “enemies” are mobilizing again, in order to be protected from the “demolished” German armies and fleets – which were generally never a given!  Against that, there is no law that can avail, rather one must possess strength and power in order to oppose these mobilizations forcefully in the manner of Ludendorff.

<p>The speaker started to discuss the result brought about by the international Jewish financial institutions as well as German foreign policy in the “great events of 1914.” ... The Jewish money-international nevertheless came away with its victory, because “money rules the world,” even in Germany.  The German press, nine-tenths of them, became indirect instruments of the enemy.  By them and by Jew-socialists bribed with Jewish money, the “deathly exhausted” Army, from lowest private to highest Field Marshal, was “stabbed in the back”!  (The old lie!)   The entire War policy was not all-German, but rather all-Jewish!  (uproarious applause and foot-stomping)  The speaker says that some of the Independent Social Democrats in attendance better hold onto their seats, and see that they don’t fall off, because the best is yet to come.  (This clever invitation of Herr Hitler is never accepted!)  And then Hitler directs “blow after blow” against the evil “Jew-socialists” in the same old way of “dressing the ranks.”  The documents concerning protection of immigrants, which we have published, as well as the “MP,” appear to stick in his craw.  He denies us the right to call ourselves independent, because we are “dependent on Jews.”  We only pretend to fight against international capital in order to throw sand in the eyes of the masses (as Herr Hitler understands so well).  The speaker says that we support capital, because we are dependent on it.  The speaker, in closing, “gets on his high horse” so far as to say that we ourselves are Jewish capitalists.  He wants to administer nationalist and racial sentiments to the people.  For that it is not enough to shout Hurrah, but rather to stand by the people in their misfortune so that they might rise up again to the “godly heights” of former power and glory.  This can only occur through work, work, and more work (but has Herr Hitler ever worked at all himself?)  Respect for the calloused hand must take first place, because that is the only way the people can rise again.  Away with the Jews!  Germany for the (pure) Germans!  Whoever wants this should sign up with the National “Socialist Workers Party”!!  Uproarious applause and foot-stomping like a buffalo herd “thanked” the loudmouth for his “lecture.”  The speaker then made it known that there were still unfinanced expenses for the support of Gottfried Feder and writer Köhler for “National Socialism.”  For this undertaking as well as for placards and leaflets, money is needed, and he asked the meeting to support it through voluntary contributions.  He could not go to the Jews like the other socialist parties!?

<blockquote>... The long-winded teacher law [of Aug. 14, 1919] is a model example of how laws should not be made.  More satisfactory – from a mere standpoint of form, as to substance it was really set up to our conscience – is the constitution-proclamation of the Free State of Bavaria, but it was produced outside the Landtag, the Landtag only pronounced its Ja and Amen. The little bit of improving modifications are only for the totally harmless points. The spirit of the constitution is not affected by them. Now that the child is well along in development, Hoffmann appears, “the sly one,” bringing up thoughts of resigning, and “our people” appear well-disposed enough to take the odium upon themselves for its further development, and so at the end of the day, he will figure as the author of the revolution and the republic in the later history of our beloved Bavaria. If only we Bishops had an independent and really Catholic press! It is pitiful.

<p>Wouldn’t Your Excellency still want to include in the pastoral letter a little passage that would also touch upon something of the issue of conscience with respect to the new republican constitution and that would be just a pointer to the recent word of the Apostolic See? [letter from Pope Benedict XV to the German Bishops, July 15, 1919] In the pastoral letter to the people I would have also frankly desired a warning from the supreme shepherd against the immeasurably increasing pleasure-seeking of the masses (dancing entertainment to all extremes!) But I see that I go too far and am becoming like Cato the Censor. Your Excellency, please excuse my presumption!

<p>Perhaps section 10 of the constitution-proclamation gives us a weapon ready at hand to arouse our ever more sleepy, apathetic and unfortunately also unprincipled people to an energetic defense and opposition toward all the monstrosity that the Revolution has brought us and will yet bring to us.

<blockquote>Re: Relations between Church and State in Bavaria. – The new Bavarian Constitution

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,
<p>By date of this September 29th, Mr. Hoffmann, Minister President and Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Education and Cultural Affairs, sent me a letter, which I carry out my duty to report herewith, translated from the German:

<p>“I have the honor to communicate to Your Excellency that the new Constitution of the Bavarian Republic (<em>Freistaat</em>) has been published and has entered into effect.  I hereby enclose for you a copy of the Official Gazette, containing the text of this Constitution.

<p>“With the revolution commenced for Germany and Bavaria a new period of their history. The Bavarian Republic, with the entrance into effect of the new Constitution, rests upon a solid legal foundation recognized by all the population.

<p>“I hope that the relations between the Holy See and the new Bavaria will be good, and I have already provided that the Minister of Bavaria, Baron Otto von Ritter zu Grünstein, returned to Rome immediately after the conclusion of the peace.

<p>“I take this occasion with pleasure etc.”

<p>The same day that I received this letter, that being this September 30th, I responded to Mr. Minister in the following terms:

<p>“I have the honor to acknowledge to Your Excellency the receipt of Your esteemed letter dated the 29th of this month and to thank You at the same time for the exemplar of the new Bavarian Constitution courteously sent to me, which I will examine with interest and attention.
<p>“I cultivate the most sincere and warm votives for Bavaria’s felicitous future and join myself from the heart to the hope expressed by Your Excellency that the relations between the Holy See and the Bavarian Government will be good, assuring You that for my part, I will see to contributing with all my strength to this intention.

<p>“With sentiments etc.”

<p>Meanwhile a crisis has arisen in the Bavarian Government that is still not resolved, about which I will have the honor to recount to Your Most Reverend Eminence in a special Report, and which has brought in consequence a further delay in the proposed negotiations on the Concordat. Despite this, and in expectation that the negotiations will begin, I have actively sought to influence Mr. Hoffmann by means of deputies of the Bavarian <em>Volkspartei</em>, or Bavarian Center Party, rousing them to exert pressure on him (as coming from them and without naming or compromising in any way either myself or the Holy See), to get him to recognize in Bavaria as well the full and absolute freedom in the appointment to ecclesiastical offices, established in the Constitution of the German Empire (cf. Report No. 13822 dated this August 18th) and to allow at the same time the continuation not only of the obligatory subsidies, but also of those that are so-called free or voluntary, which have up to now been remitted by the Bavarian State to the Church. In this regard I must also add that some of the aforesaid deputies have confidentially expressed to me their fear that Mr. Baron von Ritter, being an excellent personage and motivated by the best sentiments, attempted, once he reached Rome, to obtain from the Holy See a promise or hope of some sort of participation by the State in the appointment to ecclesiastical offices (for example, in a form subject to confidential agreement), all the more since, as it is said, in his Reports to the Bavarian Government he had supported the possibility and the convenience in principle of maintaining the aforementioned voluntary subsidies. If he should achieve this, these deputies think it would become naturally almost impossible to bend the obstinate and anti-clerical Mr. Hoffmann to the aforesaid recognition.

<p>At the same time, in sending the enclosed aforesaid exemplar of the Bavarian Constitution to Your Eminence, I deem it not unuseful (1) to transcribe here-enclosed, translated into Italian, the paragraphs of this Constitution concerning relations between Church and State, adding for each some observations and clarifications; (2) to indicate that in some points the Concordat of 1817 is violated, both by this Constitution and by the Constitution of the Empire or by other provisions of legislation. 

<p>I. The new Bavarian Constitution deals with the religious question and relations between Church and State in Heading IV entitled “<em>Freedom of conscience, religious societies, schools</em>.” It comprises only five paragraphs (17-21) and contains rather few legislative provisions. The reason is because Bavaria is already bound in the governance of this important matter by the Reich Constitution, as was stated with words of evident regret by Minister President Hoffmann, who in his anti-clerical spirit lamented that this had made the Church free from the State, but not vice versa the State free from the Church (cf. Proceedings of the II. Constitutional Committee on the Outline of a Constitutional Decree for the Free State of Bavaria – Bavarian Landtag – Session 1919 – First Reading – Appendix 324 – page 270)...

<blockquote>Re: Entry of the Democrats into the German Cabinet Ministry

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>As I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful report No. 13953 of September 6, 1919, it was to be foreseen with certainty that the Democratic Party would enter into the cabinet of the German Reich. And in fact on the 5th of this month, the newspapers reported that, pursuant to the proposal of the Chancellor, the Reich President, in conformity with article 53 of the Constitution, has appointed State Minister Dr. Schiffer to be Minister of Justice and the Mayor of Cassel, Dr. Koch, to be Interior Minister.  The former also takes the position of Vice Chancellor.  Minister David, who up to now directed the Interior Ministry, remains in the Cabinet as Minister without portfolio.

<p>The difficulties that impeded the entry of the Democratic Party into the government were primarily two-fold; the issue of the law concerning industrial councils (<em>Betriebsräte</em>), and that which is now greatly agitating public opinion, sad to say, the presence and activity of Finance Minister Erzberger in the Government. Originally the Democrats had wanted to force Erzberger’s exit from the Cabinet, but then they contented themselves with his giving up the position of Vice Chancellor and hoped that his preponderant influence in the domestic and foreign policy of the Reich would be rendered very limited. In parliamentary circles and in the press, word was circulated that America in particular views Erzberger with distrust as Finance Minister, and that no financial concessions of any sort will be made to Germany so long as he memains at the aforesaid Ministry. It could be said that today the Reichstag and the press are divided into camps based on whether or not they are for Erzberger. The Center Party supports him, but only up to a certain point. The Socialists and the Independent Socialists tolerate him for his cooperation in social questions and because - as I have been assured by well-informed sources - it is primarily due to him that the peace treaty was signed by Germany. The Democrats and the Conservatives detest him in a particular way and attribute to him and his foreign and financial policies the catastrophe into which the nation has fallen. It is also said that the Socialists, in order not to alienate the Center Party by speaking openly against Erzberger, have desired the entry of the Democrats into the Cabinet, so that they can get rid of the Finance Minister without compromising the Socialist Party in the eyes of the Center Party.

<p>The press in general is welcoming the entry of the Democrats into the Cabinet as a reinforcement of the Bauer Ministry and of his authority, and also as an improvement of the domestic and foreign situation of the country, in the sense that now the three strongest political parties are represented in the Government and can work to give a new impulse to this Government’s policy.

<p>As far as appears, the general policy of the Reich will not undergo essential changes with the entry of the Democratic Party into the Government, nor will the influence of the Center Party be diminished.

<p>It is expected that another Democrat will be appointed to the new Ministry that will be created for economic reconstruction (<em>das Ministerium des Wiederaufbaues</em>).

<a name="26"></a><p><strong>Oct. 14, 1919</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri:

<blockquote>Re: Threat of Bavarian Government crisis

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>At various times there has been talk of a possible crisis in the Bavarian Government. The discussions of the political parties, which since several days ago have been unfolding in the press of the Majority Socialists and of the Bavarian Volkspartei, especially about religion and school policy, have recently come to a climax. The decisive thrust toward the crisis was given by the meeting of the Bavarian Socialists held in Nuremberg this September 27 and 28. After a long discussion about the political situation in Bavaria, the following agenda was unanimously approved: “The conference of Bavarian Socialists, held in Nuremberg the 27th and 28th of September, has discussed the political difficulties of the Socialists and the situation of the party in the cabinet. The conference expresses its full trust in the representatives of the party in the Government. It observes that a particular difficulty of the Socialist Party in Bavaria is the fact that the so-called Government of Hoffmann is regarded as a Socialist Government, while it is clear that the composition of the Government and the Landtag precludes a purely Socialist policy. Therefore the Conference proposes a radical reform of the Cabinet Ministry. It authorizes comrades Hoffmann, Segitz and Endres to resign from the Ministry if the reform deemed necessary by the Conference cannot be effected.”

<p>As a result of this resolution, the entire press was in agreement in observing that the first duty of the Landtag, which was to convene on the 1st of October, would be to reform the Cabinet. And thus for the first time in Bavaria the parliamentary system would have to carry out its principal function, that of forming the Government; since, as Your Most Reverend Eminence well recalls, the current Hoffmann Government was born solely from a compromise in the Landtag, reduced to impotence as the result of the crisis produced by the assassination of Eisner and the Central Council of soldiers, workers and farmers, which had taken power into their hands.

<p>The reason that drove the Socialists to this resolution in Nuremberg is that in truth the current coalition cabinet bears the signature and responsibility of Socialists, but in fact the representatives of this party are in a minority there. It is to be observed, however, that this situation was put before the Socialist press right in the days of the trials of the assassins of the hostages perpetrated by the Communists in this last month of May, a period in which the responsibility of the Government appeared quite terrible, whether for the lack of energy it demonstrated in repressing the anarchist uprising of April, or because it was the one that had to speak the final word about the condemnation of the assassins, making least use of the right to pardon them.

<p>On the other hand, the press of the Bavarian Volkspartei had conducted an increasingly vehement campaign against Minister President Hoffmann for his openly anti-religious school policy. Thus, fundamentally, the crisis appeared as a logical and fatal necessity produced by the situation of struggle between the two principal Bavarian political parties, the Socialists and the Center Party (Bavarian Volkspartei).

<p>Interminable complicated discussions were protracted day after day among the various political delegations and committees of the Landtag, but nothing could come of them beyond a declaration, by which the Center Party made a halfway disavowal of the attacks appearing in the Catholic press, and especially in the Bayerischer Kurier, against Hoffmann, and then an announcement that for making a definitive decision about the crisis, there needed to be consultations by the various parties with their own organizations, and that this would be done within a short timeframe.

<p>Meanwhile the Bavarian Volkspartei found itself in this <em>Impasse</em>: on the one hand it would have to accept the responsibility of the Government, being the numerically strongest party; on the other hand, accepting this responsibility would have run the risk of a series of compromises, being obligated, once in the Government, to settle all the matters pending from the war, to confront all the arduous issues created by the new state of affairs, especially in the social and financial realms, and finally, not to speak of further matters, to resolve the threatening problems of food and material life that will appear in the next winter, and to that it suffices to add the absolute lack of men in that party who can truly impress with their name and their past record. In a speech delivered on October 6th, in Deggendorf, Mr. Held, Head of the Landtag delegation of the Bavarian Volkspartei, refuted the reasoning put forward by the Socialists for now sharing Government responsibility with the bourgeois parties, that is the polemics of the press against Minister President Hoffmann. These polemics have existed ever since November of last year, said Held, and they intensified in January and February of this year. Why did the Socialists not want a recomposition of the Government back then? Instead the Socialist Party took power into its hands during the revolution, formed a Government by itself (while in the elections it only received a third of the votes), and also demonstrated its firm intent during the Councils Republic to seek power solo and maintain it solo. Only now that they need to take on the inheritance of the Councils Republic, with all its financial consequences, the Socialists think of trying to share the responsibility of power, which they realize they cannot bear any longer by themselves. We want to remain in the coalition, added Held, and work with it, but we propose that the Minister President find a middle way in the Government, by which it would be possible not to violate the convictions of the majority of the Bavarian population, and to refrain from all that could offend them. If this does not work out, any form of cooperation is impossible. The Socialists must not think that a mere gesture from them will suffice for them to have to submit to the Minister President. That is not consistent with the Constitution or with the parliamentary political system. If it is not possible to work out a satisfactory solution to the governmental crisis, there remains no other possibility than to dissolve the Landtag.

<p>Dissolution of the Landtag was in fact much discussed by various newspapers in the days of the crisis.  The current political situation in Bavaria is, however, so complicated that it cannot be clearly predicted what would be the results of new elections. Naturally each party has maintained that it would be the winner and not the loser.

<p>Held, for example, in the quoted speech, after having flashed the possibility of new elections, added: Then we will see what the people will say of the Hoffmann Government. The Socialists must not think that the Bavarian people would reject the idea of new elections. I am convinced that they have learned to distinguish where truly lies the good of the fatherland, whether with the Socialists or with the Bavarian Volkspartei. A Ministry of the Bavarian Volkspartei cannot assume the responsibility for the work of the Hoffmann Government, especially for what concerns school policy and fiscal policy. All the press, from the Democrats to the Independent Socialists, would have put it on the Bavarian Volkspartei, making it responsible for all the discomforts of the land, and above all the Minister President, to which the Bavarian Volkpartei would have to respond: I cannot do anything!

<p>But the Democrats strongly opposed new elections. They said that an appeal to the body of the electorate during the coming winter, when there are already fears of uprisings and agitations because of food conditions and the lack of coal and of work, could not be desired by any party other than by egoism. Thus the consequences of new elections, in a period so agitated, would fall not only on the shoulders of the Socialists, who would have provoked them by their resolution at Nuremberg, but also upon those of the Bavarian Volkspartei, which, through party egoism, would have seconded the desire of the Socialists. Naturally the Democrats made the fullest reservations about the rosy expectations of the Center Party for results favorable to it in the eventuality of elections. Moreover, concluded the Democrats, the elections could only take place in the coming months, while we <em>now</em> have sufficient security in the consolidation of our political situation and in the authority and force of the Government, and this can only occur with a coalition Ministry.

<p>The Socialists tried to turn back against the Bavarian Volkspartei the arguments espoused by Held. They said (as was read in No. 234 of the Munich <em>Post</em>) that a Minister President who has public opinion against him has to respond that he cannot do anything. But the Hoffmann Cabinet, according to the press of the Center Party, has public opinion against it. Therefore it cannot govern, and that is why it wants to hand over power to the Bavarian Volkspartei. As to new elections, it is not only we Socialists who want them, but it is the Bavarian Volkspartei that is proposing to bring them about by its refusal to take power: but Mr. Held knows that in an electoral battle we will not fail to call the voters’ attention to this situation.

<p>Finally a meeting of the various parties occurred. The evening of the 9th of this month, the Bavarian Volkspartei held an impressive assembly, in which the most influential men of the party took part. After a heated discussion, an agenda was voted that more or less repeated what Held had said in his above-quoted speech:   
<p>If up to now a Ministry of their side has made the Socialists comfortable, the Bavarian Volkspartei now does not have any desire to assume power under such difficult conditions and such frightful responsibilities. Therefore the Coalition Ministry remains, with which the Bavarian Volkspartei will gladly cooperate if changes will result in the school and religion policy. If the schools do not follow such a program, the Bavarian Volkspartei does not fear elections, which will have to be held according to the new election law. - It must also be added that, according to what the leaders of the Bavarian Volkspartei have secretly confided in me, there is also another serious reason why this party could not accept the Minister Presidency at the current moment, and it is the fear that the army (Reichswehr), in which Socialists also abound, would not offer to defend a Government not presided over by a Socialist against new Communist and Spartacist agitations.

<p>Since the Democrats were also, at one of their meetings, demonstrably against having a Cabinet crisis, there remains only the word of the Socialists. And it was spoken at a meeting of the party, the 12th of this month, in Munich. An agenda was voted at that meeting that sounded more or less like this: The bourgeois parties wanted the Socialists to take responsibility for the Government during the events of February 21 (assassination of Eisner); the bourgeois parties in May came together with the Socialists to form a coalition with a program that was drawn up by common agreement, which has been implemented up to now; as a result the bourgeois parties have had responsibility for all the work of the Government up to today. That notwithstanding, these parties have obstructed the activity of the Government in every way; they have proclaimed it responsible for all the woes of the land; they have not wanted to accept full responsibility for the Government, which the Socialists are now offering them; and instead they have decided that the current Cabinet presided over by Hoffmann should remain in power. Thus the responsibility of all the parties is established for the entire activity that has developed up to now and that will develop in consequence of the current Government. The representatives of the Bavarian Volkspartei and of the Democrats have, by their own acts, recognized as unfounded the innumerable attacks against the Socialists who are in the Government. In sum, the cited agenda concludes that the Socialists under current circumstances cannot assume the responsibility of new elections, which would aggravate the frightful difficulties that are presented by the coming winter. Everything occurring in the crisis ends up with the observation that it is a matter of a tempest in a teapot and that things remain as they began.

<p>That is to say, the Coalition Ministry under Hoffmann remains, and there has only been this novelty, that the Minister of Finance, Dr. Speck of the Center Party, has been appointed Vice-President of the Cabinet.

<p>The fact that the Socialists have not wanted to face elections has been praised by their press as an act of glowing patriotism that must be shown to the country, which should recognize the sacrifice they have made in continuing the management of the Government in such difficult conditions; but it could also be explained by their uncertainty about the results of future elections. Indeed, on the one hand the school policy of Hoffmann, on the other hand the impossibility of contenting the country in fiscal and food policy (impossibilities that will get worse in the imminent winter) make for conjectures that many adherents of the Socialist party will turn their backs to it in possible elections; while the Center Party, not being directly charged with and responsible for the Government, will be able to win the sympathies of many. Indeed a rather widespread and serious opinion is that in the eventuality of elections, the Center Party and the Independents would come out ahead. To the latter would stream all the malcontents and those disillusioned with Socialism, who would not want to go over to the Center Party because of their political and religious convictions.

<p>Viewed from this perspective, the current situation and the threatened crisis that have consolidated it could bear good fruit for the future.

<p>Summing it all up, the Center Party (Bavarian Volkspartei) has had a victory. It did not want a Ministerial crisis and it did not take place; it wanted the direct responsibility for the Government to be on the Socialist Party and it has obtained that; since, although the Socialists say that this responsibility must be shared also with the bourgeois parties, yet the people will continue to attribute it to the Socialist Party that directs the Cabinet.  It only remains to be seen if the Center Party will be able to obtain that Mr. Hoffmann change his school and religion policy.

<p>From J. Butler Wright

<p>Dear Lanier:
   
<p>With reference to my telegram to you No. 3253 of October 16, 1 p.m., I am sending along today copy of the document referred to.  This document came into the hands of Sir Basil Thomson from French sources, and I am informed that it was compiled by a Russian officer, whose identity is not known here.  For your own information I would state that Thomson obtained this during a protracted conversation with Prince Yousupoff who, perhaps you will remember, acquired a certain amount of notoriety some time ago by murdering Rasputin.
   
<p>You will note that it is stated on the first page that this information was in some way “établie par les services officiels américains (transmise par le Haut Commissaire de la République Française aux Etats-Unis).”  The source of this document is therefore obscure, and it is well within the range of possibility that the statements made in it have no basis of proof.  However, Thomson has received intelligence from several sources that the Bolsheviks are receiving money from wealthy American Jews, and he is anxious for our assistance to confirm or disprove these rumors.  Consequently, I would be glad if you could send me any facts bearing upon the alleged connection between Jacob Schiff et al with the Bolsheviks, and in particular with Martens.  

<p>The editors of the MORNING POST, at Thomson’s request, have consented to withhold this information from publication at least for the present.  He has promised to do nothing further until he hears from us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>J. Butler Wright to L. Lanier Winslow

<p>Dear Lanier:

<p>Referring to my letter No. 3. of the 17th instant and the telegram to which it referred - and, of course, to your reply - all regarding the anti-Semitic material recently secured by the MORNING POST, I have never had the slightest doubt but that you were fully aware that our reaction as to the inevitable effect of the publication of such material was the same as yours.  I was, however, frankly glad to find that your telegram expressed identically my own views in the matter.

<p>My limited but somewhat hectic experience in connection with Russia and her affairs have always led me to believe that a criticism on Russia from French sources is, more often than not, colored by the intensity of the revengeful feeling that every Frenchman - official or otherwise - whom I have met entertains toward that country - a matter, in the last analysis, of the pocket!  If there be added to that the anti-Semitic tinge and it be expressed in a document with so little contiguity of narration or so conspicuous a lack of foundation - the result would be nothing short of a prairie fire, especially as affecting the relations between England and the United States.

<p>I think we have the whole thing in cold storage, but I await an expression of your opinion regarding the whole matter which has, of course, also received the attention of the Ambassador.

<p>Yours sincerely,

<blockquote>Re: German Embassy at the Vatican

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Following up my respectful report no. 14360 of October 12th, I am given to attentively report to Your Most Reverend Eminence how the question of the creation of an Embassy of the German Empire at the Holy See continues to be agitated both in the press of all colors and in the discussions of the various political parties, and also in the Reichstag Committee that has been occupied in recent days with the analysis of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>It is evident at this point that in Germany there is full appreciation of the rightly assessed immense political-religious power of the Catholic Church, and it is considered indispensable for the true good of the Nation to maintain good relations with the Holy See. A few days ago the Foreign Minister, the Socialist Dr. Müller, declared in the aforesaid Committee that Germany attaches the greatest interest to good relations with the Holy See and that with these dispositions the question of the creation of a Reich Embassy at the Vatican is being negotiated.

<p>Actually, if there are some difficulties facing this proposal, they arise from the fact that Prussia just like Bavaria does not want to give up its former right to have its own Representative at the Holy See.  Certainly entering into this are political interests and the spirit of particularism shared by various German States, despite the forces that are making a union of them under the centralizing policy of the Berlin Government; but it cannot be denied that this struggle to keep their own Diplomatic Representation at the Holy See indicates the full importance that they give to good relations with the Holy See.

<p>In the aforementioned Committee, the Foreign Minister, upon questioning about this, stated that for now the question of the creation of the Embassy cannot be immediately resolved, precisely because Bavaria does not want to give up its Legation at the Holy See, and Prussia, if Bavaria does not yield, would certainly not want to lose the same privilege.

<p>Dr. Müller expressed, however, the hope that the negotiations will bring a happy solution. From a good source I then learned that the Minister President of Bavaria, Hoffmann, to ease the difficulty that could perhaps arise from the question of reciprocity and also not to give up the honor of at least keeping the Apostolic Nunciature in Bavaria, had proposed that there be a Nuncio accredited to the Reich, but that his residence would remain in Munich. I add, however, that up to now the Berlin Government has not responded to this proposal.

<p>Meanwhile one cannot fail to observe in this state of affairs that the greatly merited importance that is being given to the Catholic Church in a Germany that is majority Protestant is due to the zeal, the activity and the incomparable organization of the German Catholics. By now any Government that wants to have power in its hands must take account of Catholics and thereby of the Center Party. And it is most significant that even a revolutionary Socialist Government, like the current one, cannot manage without this immense force that the Catholics in Germany represent and that they know how to assert in the defense of the religious and political interests of their party.

<p>Obviously it has not been sympathy for the Catholic Church that has inspired a Constitution so broad-minded toward the Catholics as the one given by the Socialist Government of Ebert. It has been solely the work of the Center Party to impose upon the Socialist Party not only its own cooperation in the Cabinet, without which it would not have been able to govern, but likewise a Constitution that, if not good in theory, yet at least in practice today places German Catholics in conditions of greater freedom than under the past regime.

<p>Everything thus gives hope that indeed the question of establishing the embassy at the Holy See will be resolved according to the desires of the Center Party, which have just been presented by Deputy Pfeiffer in the oft-mentioned Committee.

<blockquote>“Religion and Church in Public Life: Keynote Address of His Excellency Archbishop von Faulhaber at the plenary assembly on Sunday, 26 October, in the Krone Circus”

<p>My dear Diocesans!

<p>[I welcome the times in which the spirits are clearly distinguished and hate the times of double-mindedness.  For Christ or against Christ. We want distinction and decisiveness, we want clarity about the spirits.  We do not want politics, but if we must indeed protect consciences for the tasks of state citizenship, it is indispensable to outline the issues of public life, especially with my theme:] 

<p><strong>Religion and Church in public life.</strong>

<p>The new era has the desire to remove the influence of religion and the Church from public life.  [The Weimar Reich Constitution is a new milestone of this modern development since the Peace of Westphalia.  And Bavaria has hereby not only danced the Reich’s tune, it has preferred to go yet much further in pressuring the Church and religion out of public life. (Cries: Unfortunately!)] Therefore we must see to it that religion and the Church have a right in public life, that they are a state necessity, and that they are an eternal blessing for public life.

<p><strong>Religion and the Church have a right in public life.</strong>

<p>Christ gave his apostles the mission:  Go out into all the world and teach all peoples! To the whole world and all nations then, the good news must go.  There is salvation in no other name, there is no other foundation laid.  The religion of the cross shall become the salvation of the world and renew the face of the whole earth.  Indeed for public societies of the people, the message of Christ shall become the yeast that penetrates the whole mass.  The savior had already said to the apostles: What I whisper in your ear, you will thereupon preach from the rooftops, that is, in the public squares of the towns and villages. And when Peter, the gatekeeper of the Kingdom of God on earth, shook the dust of the Jewish land off his feet, his face then was turned toward Rome, that place where the military roads of world history came together. Not in the deep valleys of the Himalayas, not in the solitude of the African deserts, but in Rome, upon the capital of knowledge and world history of the time, was his doctrinal see established. You see, Christ built his Church on the military roads of history.  Religion and Church have a right in public life. [(Applause.) Note: All audience reactions were omitted in the version published in <em>Documentation Catholique</em>.]

<p>There comes now from Erfurt a new gospel: religion is a private affair. If that means everyone can take of it whatever he wants, that anyone can put out his own catechism, as he wishes, if that means religion is not a community activity, if we are thus supposed to tear down our churches and smash our organs, if that means religion is only and exclusively a private affair, then the saying is false. (Quite right!) If it means religion is first and foremost a personal affair, then the saying is correct. First the interior life must be leavened by the Kingdom of God, first must the individual possess the spirit of prayer and of faith, of love for God and love for neighbor, before confessing this spirit on the streets of public life. Christ said to the Pharisees: Go into your chamber and pray! To the Pharisees, who went about the streets with their piety, who used piety as placard without having the Kingdom of God interiorly, to them he said: Whoever denies me before people, him I will also deny before my Father  who is in heaven. (Applause.) A human being is a personal unity, he is not an amalgam of a private half and a state citizen half. (Very good! strong acclamation.) So he cannot be inwardly a Christian and outwardly a pagan. (Very good!) One cannot be for Christ and gather for Christ at home with the family, and on the other hand be against Christ and scatter against Him upon the street as an official, as a parliamentary delegate. (Applause.) One can change coats when one goes out, but one cannot change what is in the soul as one changes clothes. (Applause.) If the individual is obligated to acknowledge God as Lord and Creator, and if the civil society of the state arises from individual persons alone, then why should that which is an obligation for the individual not also be reflected in public life. (Acclamation.)

<p>[Yet a third right pertains to religion and Church in public: a political right! Struggle against persons or parties is alien to us. For me, person or party is the form of an ideology and false doctrine. (Very good!) I am speaking not of the party of Social Democracy, I am speaking here of the false doctrine of Socialism. (Strong acclamation.)] If Socialism now advances the saying, religion is a private affair, then it must logically also advance the saying: hostility to religion is a private affair. (Tempestuous applause.) But if an anti-religious spirit lives in politics and weaves legislation on its weaver’s loom, then religion too must occupy itself with politics. (Acclamation.) How can one say: You are intruding from the ecclesiastical realm into the governmental-political realm, if one is continually intruding from the governmental realm into the ecclesiastical realm? (Loud cries of Bravo.) A few days ago a newspaper spoke out with an openness that is worthy of thanks: “The order of the day is the altercation between Socialism and the Church.” How can we, then, shut up religion as a private affair within the four walls of the house? (Absolutely right!) Now we also understand, my worthies, why the fight is always against the Catholic Church at the end of the day. All these battles of the day are local skirmishes in a great world battle, which began at the start of history between the good and evil spirits. The closer the fullness of time approaches, the more clearly the two camps, for Christ and against Christ, are revealed, and the more clearly appears the Catholic world religion as the Kingdom of Christ. The names change, the contrasts remain. Many a one thinks he is a big player and is only a piece on a chessboard. Religion and the Church have a right in public life.

<p><strong>Religion and Church are a State Necessity for Public Life.</strong>

<p>Here I go back to ancient Plato and his fundamental principle: Whoever destroys religion destroys the foundations of the social order. (Absolutely right!) It would be good if Ministers of Education and Culture had to first undergo an exam about this ... (the rest of the words were drowned out by a tumultuous storm of applause). One state necessity is certainly authority, trust in those who are to lead the people. We know, unfortunately, how many it has smitten among us in Bavaria. For us, however, all authority rests upon God’s Fourth Commandment, and God’s Fourth Commandment sets this earthly authority upon God’s authority in the first three Commandments. If, therefore, a state government throws the first three Commandments out the window, then it has removed the foundations of its own authority and the people have said with instinctive logical correctness: If you no longer believe in the authority of God, then we too no longer believe in your authority. (Tumultuous applause.) Whoever wants to have authority must acknowledge the Fourth Commandment and thereby religion. Whoever destroys religion destroys the foundations of social life.

<p>Sound principles are certainly a state necessity. Only strong dogmas create strong nations. We have sound principles in our Catholic dogmas, anointed with the blood of martyrs since the time of the Catacombs, consecrated through the centuries by their confessions of faith. And these statements of the faith of the Church, they shine into the life of people and also strengthen the loyalty and faith of people. Where faith in God dwindles, the people’s trust necessarily becomes shaky. Sound principles are something we have in the glorious work that appeared at Pentecost in 1918, in the Code of Canon Law, the constitutional proclamation of the Catholic Church. 1918 brought us the constitutional proclamation of the Church, 1919 the constitution of the Reich. The constitution of the Church, which grew up from the Church’s life of law as a growth of peaceful development; the Reich constitution, the child of the Revolution. And the aftermath would indeed show what a difference there is between the laws of God’s realm and those of earthly realms. Everything is flooding and surging and pressing around us; but we do not want new floods, we want a rock in the flood. The Church’s Code of Canon Law is a rock of law in the floods of our time. There God’s spirit hovers over the chaos. There, sound goals without compromise (Very good!), there, a leadership to which we gladly extend our hand. Just compare what programs of recent years have had to be struck down and refashioned. (Cheerful acclamation.)

<p>Sound foundational principles, but also sound foundational laws! A foundational law is more than a foundational principle. A foundational law is a principle that offers a “You shall!” and takes me by the hand and sets me on a specified path. Such foundational laws are: Honor your father and mother, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not lie. The Decalogue has given us the foundational laws of public life. To be sure, these are also points of natural law. But historically it is firmly established that only where these laws erect a longterm governmental structure worthy of humanity, do the citizens feel religiously obligated to their fundamental laws. If some individuals say: I too get there, without religion – they should not forget that they are living on soil where the mission of Christianity has introduced these foundational principles as the common intellectual heritage of our time. (Acclamation and applause.) How then will the state, when it casts its laws and regulations into the world, obligate its citizens in conscience to its laws? By police and new letters of the law? A state authority that is supported only by police and handgranades is going about on crutches. There must come about an obligation by conscience, and that comes only from religion. So it is remarkable, on the one hand one wants to exclude religion from public life, and on the other hand, one has to admit there is absolutely no moral obligation, no matter of conscience, thus no possibility of establishing the entirety of the state if it is not done with the foundation of religion. Whoever destroys religion destroys the foundation of the social order. So, have those who are advancing the saying that religion is a private affair, have they totally forgotten that there can be no real overcoming of capitalism (Very good!), that we, if we do not succeed in educating and obligating consciences in citizenship, will inevitably fail in actually breaking our era’s spirit of profit-seeking and damnable Mammonism?

<p>It was a world-historical moment when the final reading of the constitution ended in Weimar. There were the men of state standing around their constitution and asking themselves: Now we have a constitution; but how are we now going to obligate the citizens to it? (Very good! Jollity.) Naturally we are going to obligate them as in the good old days (Jollity), with the formula of an oath: I swear! But no! Swearing means to call on God’s name. For God’s sake, we really want to keep this name out of public life. The way out: The oath is taken as a religious oath by those who believe in the name of God, and in a civil oath for those who do not believe in it. (Jollity and acclamation.) But swearing an oath is not speaking with a forked tongue, it is intended to provide clarity and truth (Bravo!), it should rule out forked-tonguedness and double-mindedness in an important matter. (Bravo!) Either an oath is an appeal to God from the mouth of those who believe in God, or there is no longer any oath. (Absolutely right!) If, on the one hand, God is given the heave-ho, right in his face, from public life, then he cannot be summoned back again when you are helpless without him. (Prolonged applause.) We declare the oath permissible in public life, we never yet discovered in Kaiser era that it was a piece of the Middle Ages. But we must guard ourselves against the holy oath being emptied of meaning by this civil concept and guard against the holy oath being degraded to a matter of raw police power. (Absolutely right!) ...

<blockquote>Re: The Catholic Congress in Munich

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>From the 24th to the 27th of this month a Catholic Congress was held in Munich, which turned out successfully. The war having ceased even while a state of peace had not yet been proclaimed between the Entente Countries and Germany, the German Catholics believed it their duty to make a public affirmation of their strength and to come together to understand the situation created for them by the extraordinary events of world conflict and revolution. They could not gather all together in a single Congress as they customarily did before the war. The coal shortages were so acute that there was a threatened immediate suspension of all rail transportation for passengers, at least for a period of 14 days.  That is why the Catholics decided to meet in diocesan Congresses.

<p>The one in Munich turned out truly impressively. During the four days of the Congress there were particular sessions of the Volksverein [People’s Association] of Catholic Germany, of students in higher education, of teachers, of male and female youth associations, of servants, workers, merchants, apprentices, of the press, of Catholic women and mothers, of students, and of the Missions.  In each of these sessions, there was ample discussion of the interests of the associations in question and important resolutions were adopted, appropriate to the necessity of the present hour.

<p>Of great interest and solemnity were the meetings of the Federations of Catholic organizations, which gathered all the various associations in a general assembly, both in various churches for religious functions, and in the vast “Krone Circus” for speeches.

<p>The second of these general gatherings, that of October 26th, which concluded the Congress, merits a special report for its particular solemnity and importance.

<p>The “Krone Circus” was packed to the rafters. It is calculated that there were ten thousand persons. All social spheres were represented there: Princes of the Royal Family, Aristocracy, University Professors, Clergy, Religious Orders, students, workers, etc., and a truly impressive mass of people.  As it was not possible to give entry to all the other people who wanted to take part in the meeting, a parallel assembly had to be held in another very spacious locale.  In the meeting in the “Krone Circus,” significant speeches were delivered. The first to speak was the University of Munich Professor and Privy Councilor Dr. Beyerle, on the theme “The social order according to the spirit of Christianity.”  Then opportune words were spoken by Madame Dr. Lang-Brumann on the theme, “The way of the apostolate to alleviate social needs.” Fr. Dionisio, a Capuchin, followed and gave a magnificent Conference on “The Papacy and peace among peoples.” Speaking of the Holy Father, he called him, amidst thunderous applause from the listeners, “the friend and father of all peoples,” explaining the compassionate work of the Supreme Pontiff during the war, in bringing back peace among peoples and alleviating the suffering caused by the great worldwide catastrophe.  Also important and highly applauded was the speech by Justice Councilor Dr. Marx, who dealt with education, youth instruction and pastoral care, attacking the recent regulations from the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs about religious instruction.

<p>At this point was introduced at the podium, and greeted by most lively applause, the Archbishop of Munich, who delivered a splendid speech, learned in substance, brilliant in form, and apostolic in spirit, on the theme: “Religion and Faith in public life.”  He explained that Religion and the Church have the right to be in public life; are a necessity for public life; and are a blessing for it. He spoke strongly against the Constitution of Weimar and that of Bavaria, against the anti-religious school policy of the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs in Bavaria, against the de-Christianization of public life, and concluded with truly felicitous emphasis, exhorting Catholics to wake up and pay attention, that their spiritual goods not be harmed and the rights of the Church not be violated. A storm of applause crowned the inspired words of the excellent Prelate.

<p>After the Archbishop’s speech, the President of the Congress read the telegram from Your Most Reverend Eminence imparting the Apostolic Benediction upon the Congress-goers. It was greeted with obvious signs of touching gratitude by the entire immense audience, which rose to its feet to hear it read.  

<p>I also believed it opportune to intervene in the meeting at the beginning of Mons. Faulhaber’s speech, to say a few appropriate words in German to the Congress, expressing the paternal satisfaction that His Holiness had shown in learning how this Congress had turned out and encouraging all to continue in the love of Religion and the Pope. And finally I imparted the Benediction in the name of His Holiness, which was received with the greatest devotion and piety, while the frenetic applause was singing praise to the Supreme Pontiff.  The unforgettable solemnity concluded with the singing of the Te Deum.

<p>Not being able, because of work, to intervene in all the numerous particular gatherings, I briefly attended those of the Catholic Press and the students. In one and the other I spoke some brief words of satisfaction and encouragement and urged devotion to the Church and to the Supreme Pontiff.  In that of the Press (<em>Pressverein</em>) – presided over by Msgr. Triller, Vicar General of Eichstätt, who is personally known to the Holy Father, to Whom he is most humbly devoted with filial homage – I was able to confirm by the report that was presented me by the most zealous Secretary, the Priest Dr. Müller, how the subscribers to the Catholic newspaper “Bayerischer Kurier” are steadily growing in number from year to year in a truly consoling manner, so that this newspaper, despite its current lavishly increasing costs, can sufficiently support itself. Likewise increasing are the members of the Catholic Press Association, which were only 3,031 in 1917 and have increased to 26,757 at the end of 1918.  Here-enclosed I am sending to Your Eminence the statistics for the year 1918 of the commendable Catholic Press Association in Bavaria.

<p>The gathering of Catholic students: Thousands of youths of all ages, of serious demeanor and wide awake together, some of them having functioned as Presidents of the assembly, lined up on the platform in their characteristic uniforms; a considerable number of professors of the Lyceums and of the Universities fraternized with the students; priests and members of religious orders, former students, all animated by sentiments of true faith, all proud to be able to make such a solemn religious demonstration (since it was the first time in many years that all the student Organizations were gathered together), all of which opened up their spirit, unfortunately oppressed and worried, to comfort for the present and hope for the future; so that, with such a great number of youths so full of fervor in the defense of their own religion, these will be able to effectively resist the blows of their enemies.

<p>In this assembly various speeches were also delivered by youths and by Professors, and also here the words of the Pontifical Representative and the Apostolic Benediction imparted by him were received with devotion and unending applause, while the young President of the assembly charged me to convey to the Throne of the Holy Father the sentiments of gratitude of the Catholic university youth of Bavaria and the assurance that they would always work for Religion and for the Church.

<p>The Socialist press commented on the activities of the Congress, stating that it represented nothing other than the old cry that the Center Party used to combat Socialism: “Religion is in danger!”

<p>The liberal newspapers were more vehement and reproved the Archbishop especially for having transformed a gathering that should have been only about religious interests, into a palace of politics, accusing him of fomenting discord in the minds of the people, precisely at this moment when, with all the immense difficulties of daily life, he should have been inculcating unity and peace, as well as respect for the Authorities, which he instead so strongly attacked.  

<p>In concluding this my report, I cannot fail to indicate to Your Eminence that I was able to verify in fact how the presence of the Pontifical Representative in the popular gatherings, and in general his contact with the people, produced a great advantage for religious interests, an immense encouragement for devotion to the Holy See, and increased its prestige in a truly remarkable manner.  This was also confirmed to me by personalities of the clergy and the laity, who reported to me the profound impression produced in the masses by the presence of the Pontifical Nuncio in their midst.

<blockquote>Re: Colloquy with Minister Hoffmann – About future relations between Church and State in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Yesterday afternoon Mr. Hoffmann, President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Education and Cultural Affairs in Bavaria, finally invited me for today, to an advance discussion with him about future relations between Church and State in Bavaria. In conformity with the venerated instructions imparted to me by Your Most Reverend Eminence in the obsequious Dispatch No. 95238 of this August 23rd, I immediately accepted the invitation, and at 9:30 this morning (the hour indicated to me by the same Mr. Hoffmann) I was received at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The colloquy, marked throughout by courtesy, lasted precisely one hour, ending at 10:30.

<p>Mr. Minister began by telling me that he had gone in the past week to Berlin, where various Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs had convened in the Interior Ministry for a Conference about relations between Church and State and the school question under the new Constitution. Under the current legal order, in fact in Berlin and not in Munich, the aforesaid Constitution is interpreted and the norms for its implementation run wild; which, indeed for Bavaria itself make the work of the Apostolic Nuncio much more difficult. As to what concerns the first point, that is the relations between the State and the so-called religious societies (<em>Religionsgesellschaften</em>), Mr. Hoffmann told me that, contrary to what he himself was expecting, the second clause of article 137 of the mentioned Constitution was declared there to have already come into effect, but not the third section, according to which “the societies themselves confer their offices without cooperation by the State or Communities.” For this is required (as Article (1) has been strangely interpreted) according to the final paragraph, a further regulation by legislation of the individual States; a regulation that, it seems to Mr. Hoffmann, can be effected either by means of a simple ministerial order, or by means of a law through intervention of the Landtag. Moreover, in the same Conference it was likewise declared that international treaties, among which the most numerous include the Concordats, remain in force, to the extent, however, that their provisions are not in opposition with those of the Constitution. According to this authentic interpretation and within the aforementioned limits, the Bavarian Concordat of 1817 thus still perdures, and Mr. Minister asked me “what would be the view of Rome in this regard,” and whether it would intend to consider the Concordat as in force or no longer in force, in other words, whether it would want to proceed toward a new Convention with Bavaria.

<p>I responded by saying that I have not yet had occasion to receive instructions in this regard and that I was thus speaking exclusively in my own name, reserving my right to report, as I am obligated, to the Holy See. I did not deem it opportune to affirm the cessation of the aforesaid Concordat for the following reasons: 1st) because Your Eminence, in transmitting to me with the aforesaid dispatch no. 95238 a copy of the learned Voto of a Consultor to the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, in which such cessation is maintained, did not say to accept its conclusions.  2nd) because such an explicit assertion could in practice bring most serious harms to the Church in Bavaria. I am certainly not expected to make a critical theoretical examination of the arguments put forth by the eminent Canonist who authored said Voto; it is nonetheless my duty to inform Your Eminence how declaring the Concordat no longer in force would result in the possible loss of the only, certainly the most solid and secure basis for saving what can still be saved of the rights of the Church in Bavaria.  Indeed it is by virtue of the Concordat that it is possible to preserve the various subsidies of the State in favor of the expenses of the Bishops, the cathedral chapters, the parishes, the Seminaries, etc., contemplated in Article 138 of the Reich Constitution, of affirming the right of the Church to have its own schools of philosophy and theology in the Seminaries, and related matters. Moreover, to disengage the Church to the maximum extent possible from the State’s right of appointment and presentation to ecclesiastical offices, there is already a most efficacious argument in the Reich Constitution. 3rd) because it is confirmed to me that the fact of such an aforesaid assertion would be interpreted (albeit wrongly for sure) by the Government as a hostile attitude of the Holy See toward the new republican form of Government.

<p>Thus avoiding a direct response to the question of the permanence or cessation of the Bavaria Concordat after the recent political changes, I said to Mr. Hoffmann that, in my opinion, it would be appropriate to conclude a new convention or agreement, and I further indicated the points that, still according to my exclusively personal point of view, would be appropriate to touch upon in that regard. These points had already been prepared by me, taking them especially, with modifications and additions, from a Memorandum sent to me by the Archbishop of Bamberg after the Freising Bishops Conference of this September, and a copy of which I have the honor of transmitting here-enclosed to Your Eminence. This Memorandum was edited in the name of the Archbishops and Bishops of Bavaria; in fact, however, as it was said to me by the Archbishop of Munich – the reason why he had not subscribed to it – not all the Prelates, him included, fully agreed with the ideas stated therein as to what concerns governmental interference in the appointment to ecclesiastical offices. In it, indeed, there is an inclination in this regard, subject always, however, to the superior judgment of the Holy See, to allow an opportunity for concession to the current Bavarian Government, as also there is an inclination rather in this direction in the sentence supporting the passage to the same Government of the right of patronato concerning the parishes, as contemplated in article XI of the Concordat.

<p>Turning to my colloquy with Mr. Minister Hoffmann, I started by saying that the Church, as a result of the new Reich and Bavarian Constitutions, has lost its privileged situation under norms contained in Article I of the Concordat; it thus certainly has the right to exact in compensation a greater freedom in the field to which it is entitled. After that I explained and illustrated, as the basis for a future agreement, the following points, which I carry out my duty to reproduce here below, adding explanations necessary for better understanding them:
<em>I. The Church appoints freely to all ecclesiastical offices without cooperation from the State or the Communities. The State continues to provide its subsidies as previously, including those called free or voluntary (</em>freiwillige), <em>which must be counted in their total amount for release.</em>

<p>This point does not need explanation beyond what I have explained about Articles 137 and 138 of the Reich Constitution (cf. Report No. 13822 of last August 18) and about paragraph 18 of the Bavarian Constitution (cf. Report 14369 of this October 6). I must only add that in the aforesaid Freising Bishops Conference the Bishops were of rather differing opinions, concerning the question of free contributions, corresponding to the differing circumstances of their respective Dioceses. The Prelates, in truth, in whose territory is found the Diaspora, that is to say especially Bamberg, Speyer and Würzburg, receive much more of these contributions than the Bishops in the purely Catholic Dioceses of Southern Bavaria. All were unanimous, however, in maintaining that, giving the increasing misery and the very seriously excessive burden of taxation to which the population is subjected, it would be absurd to expect them to supply by free offerings and ecclesiastic fees the seven million Marks per year that have been represented up to now by the aforesaid subsidies, and thus it is indispensable that they be calculated in the amount to be released.

<p><em>II. For the appointment of professors of the Theological Faculties in the Universities, the State proposes one or more candidates acceptable to the Ordinary, whose advance consent is necessary before the appointment by the State itself can be effectuated. Moreover in the Philosophy Faculties of any of these Universities, there must be at least one professor of philosophy and one of history of sound Catholic doctrine in the judgment of the Ordinary.</em>

<p><em>III. Lyceums for philosophical and theological formation of clerics are established by the Dioceses, depending as such upon the Ordinary, who freely appoints the rectors and teachers</em>. (That is: <em> For the appointment of teachers in the Lyceums, the Bishop proposes the candidates to the State, which then makes the appointment).</em>

<p><em>IV. If a Professor of a Theological Faculty (or Lyceum) is judged by the Ordinary to be incapable of conducting his instruction by reason of doctrine or moral conduct, he shall be dismissed.</em>

<p>The Concordat of 1817 established in Article V: “[paragraph in Latin]”

<p>These provisions, however, were not observed by the Bavarian Government, which did not provide the appropriate funds; it obligated the students of the Seminaries to complete their studies in State institutions, over whose direction the Bishops could expect to have little influence and whose teachers could not be appointed by them or in case of need freely dismissed by them; it presumed to supervise and to limit the appointment of rectors and vice-rectors of the Seminaries, the admission of students and the administration of property. As a result of that, even today the Seminaries of Bavaria do not have their own schools subordinate to the Bishops. Students pursue their studies of the humanities for nine years in the public <em>Gymnasiums</em> of the State. For their study of philosophy and theology they must attend either a State University, where a Theological Faculty is established, or the so-called Lyceums. <em>Theological Faculties</em> in Bavaria are established in Munich and Würzburg. Instruction in philosophy in these Universities, even for future students of theology, is not a part of the theological faculty, but the lay philosophical faculty; nevertheless, in the response of the Royal State Ministry dated March 29, 1889 to the Memorandum of the Bavarian Bishops, the Government committed that in each one of these there would be, both for philosophy properly so called and for history, a professor (lay) of sound Catholic sentiments. In the University of Munich this chair of philosophy was previously held by the now decease Count von Hertling, and today by Professor Baeumker, a good Catholic, even though a layman, well known for the “Contributions to the History of Philosophy of the Middle Ages,” (<em>Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters</em>) founded by him and of which there more than a hundred issues have already been published. The Catholic instructor for history in the Philosophy Faculty of Munich is now the illustrious Prof. Grauert. The <em>Lyceums</em> “are higher schools for the study of Catholic philosophy and theology and as such have especially the purpose of providing for the formation of Clerics who are not attending a University” (Organic Provisions for the Bavarian Lyceums § 1). They are thus instituted by <em>the government</em>, established alongside the Clerical Seminaries, and they supplement the schools of philosophy and theology that according to the norms of the Concordat should have been established in the Seminaries themselves. They do not enjoy the authority to confer academic degrees, so that the Bishops provide for sending the best students to the Universities for this purpose. There are five of these in Bavaria, being located in Bamberg, Dillingen (Diocese of Augsburg), Freising, Passau and Ratisbon.
<p>Although the aforesaid Lyceums, as has been mentioned, are intended primarily for the academic formation of priests, nevertheless lay students can also attend the philosophy course of study ...

<p>As to what concerns in particular the aforementioned appointment of professors, the Bishops of Bavaria, in a Memorandum sent to the King dated October 20, 18150, asked that in the implementation of the Concordat there be given by the State funds to establish in the Seminiaries schools intended for the formation of clerics and that, at least, the Lyceums would be declared institutes of the Bishops and indissolubly united with the Seminaries, and that therefore the appointment of professors in the same would be left to the free decision of the Bishops under the norms of Article V of the Concordat. They further asked that, for the appointment of professors of the Theological Faculties in the Universities, there would be a requirement of a prior opinion and consent from the Ordinary.

<p>Although this most just request of the Bishops did not achieve the desired effect, nevertheless, by virtue of the sovereign decree of March 30, 1852 and by the consequent ministerial decision of April 8th of the same year, the Government declared that in the appointment of Lyceum professors it would have regard to the desires of the Bishops; and this assurance was repeated in the later supreme decision of October 9, 1854, which also expressly affirmed that it applied to all Lyceum professors, and not only to those in theology, and that for confirming the seats of theology in the Universities there would have to be a request for the opinion of the Ordinary concerning the theological doctrine and moral conduct of each candidate.

<p>Then, when during the time of the Kulturkampf, the above-referenced concession was revoked by the ministerial decision of November 20, 1872, a violent campaign commenced, especially in the press, which did not succeed, however, in inducing the Government to yield. Only after the Memorandum of the Bavarian Bishops dated June 14, 1888, which asked His Royal Highness the Prince Regent of Bavaria “that on the occasion of appointments of teachers in the Lyceums and of theology professors in the Universities, the Royal State Ministry would communicate to the respective Ordinaries the names of the candidates or those persons taken under consideration , and that the opinion of the Ordinaries would be given due weight,” was the right of the Bishops in this regard recognized anew. 
In fact, in the response of March 28, 1889 to the aforesaid memorandum, the von Lutz Ministry declared in the name of the Sovereign that “in the appointment of teachers in the Lyceums the greatest possible regard would be taken to the opinions and desires of the Bishops,” and that likewise “in the collation of the seats of theology in the Universities, there would be taken into account not only the opinions of the Theological Faculty and of the University Senate, but also that of the Bishop as to what concerns the doctrine and moral conduct of the candidate.”

<p>The Lyceum professors receive their stipends from the State, as also by means of these subsidies the maintenance of the Institutes themselves is provided for, although for this purpose there is also contributed the income, albeit relatively small, of special foundations. Thus, for example, the annual expenses of the Lyceum in Bamberg amount to about 80,000 Marks; the income from the foundation bring in a little more than 16,000 Marks; the remaining 64,000 Marks are given by the State.

<p>In recent times it has often been proposed, and sometimes indeed tumultuously demanded, that the Lyceums be suppressed, which by their nature have few students; but since the Center Party had the majority, these attempts were in vain.

<p>The Lyceum of Eichstatt finds itself in an exceptionally favorable situation, founded in 1838 with the consent of King Ludwig I by Cardinal Carl August von Reisach, then Bishop of that Diocese and later Archbishop of Munich...

<p>With this being said, it can be easily understood why the Bavarian Bishops are deeply concerned for the future of the Theological Faculties and the Lyceums. The Memorandum of the Archbishop of Bamberg indeed observes what very grave dangers the academic formation of the clergy would be exposed to if in the sensitive professorial positions such as theology and philosophy in these institutes, the Government were to name teachers with sentiments hostile to the Church, or with the modernist spirit, and he adds to this the fear that the current Minister Mr. Hoffmann might propose to give the Lyceums the additional function of popular higher schools, perhaps constituting for that purpose a greater number of philosophy professors, who probably imbibe anti-religious tendencies and doctrines. Therefore the Bishops are requesting that the negotiations obtain that no Lyceum professors be appointed without the prior consent of the ordinary. They make the same request also concerning the appointment of professors of philosophy in the Universities themselves, requesting that no one be appointed without being of sound doctrine in the judgment of the Ordinary. 

<p>Being an elementary norm in any negotiation to present at the outset the maximum program, except then to fall back from it in case of need into the limits of the possible, as in Points II, III and IV going beyond what the Bishops themselves have requested as the minimum. For the appointment of professors in the Theological Faculties, I adopted the formula of the Memorandum of the Bavarian Bishops in 1850, repeated moreover in the recent Memorandum of the Archbishop of Bamberg, and requesting the prior <em>consent</em> of the Ordinary; and as to two Catholic professors in the Philosophy Faculty, I have abided by the current practice, ordained by the aforementioned response of the Royal State Ministry in 1889. For the Lyceums, it has seemed opportune to me to require what is based in the Concordat, - as the Bavarian Bishops also did in the same Memorandum of 1850, - that these are to be no longer the government’s institutions, but the Bishops’, and thus subordinate to the Ordinary, who can thus freely appoint the rectors and the professors; something all the more necessary now, because of the recent school legislation. In this case, for the sum to be released as subsidies from the State to the Church there must be also included the expenses for the Lyceums in question, both because otherwise the Bishops would be totally lacking the financial means to sustain them, and because the matter of subsidies is expressly contemplated in the above-cited article of the Concordat and thus goes into Article 138 of the Reich Constitution…

<p>Finally I deemed it necessary to fix also a point regarding the removal of professors of the Theological Faculties (as also of the Lyceums, even if these were to remain governmental institutions) whom the Ordinary might judge incapable of conducting their instruction by reason of doctrine or moral conduct. A similar provision is found already express as to what concerns the Universities of Bonn, Breslau and Münster in Prussia in the respective Statutes (cf. <em>Zeitschrift für Kirchenrecht</em>, vol. 40, 1908, pp. 386 et seq.) and it was also in the Convention concluded between the Holy See and the Imperial German Government on December 5, 1902 for the University of Strasbourg.

<p><em>V. – Also the teachers of religion in the middle schools are appointed by the State according to the proposal by the Bishop and will be dismissed upon request by the Bishop for reasons indicated in the preceding numbered section.</em>

<p>The posts of teacher of religion in the middle schools were always until now instituted by the proposal of the Government by the Landtag, which voted the necessary funds. As a result of this the State exercised also the right of appointment of priests to the said offices and treated them as its employees.  Nonetheless the appointment took place by agreement with the Bishop. The Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs inquired of the respective Ordinary in advance, if he had against the candidate in question any objections from an ecclesiastical point of view, and the practice in this regard varied: sometimes the aforesaid Ministry presented to the Bishop a list of all the candidates for a post of religion teacher and requested that his view be given in that regard; other times, only some were communicated; other times, finally, it requested the judgment of the Ordinary about a sole candidate proposed for such instruction.

<p>A similar procedure corresponded, moreover, all to the public statements of the Bavarian Government. Such as indeed expressed, for example, by Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Dr. Müller in a letter to the Archbishop of Munich on December 9, 1891: “Already now, before the appointment of a religion teacher, there will always be communicated to the Most Reverend Archbishops and Bishops the list of all candidates and it is given in such a way that they will express their observations in this regard. The Government does not intend in any manner to modify or restrict this practice.” Similarly Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Dr. von Wehner stated in 1904 in the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Lords: “Currently the list of candidates for posts of religion teacher in the Gymnasiums are always communicated to the Ecclesiastical Authorities, and the names of the candidates that the Government has in view are indicated. But the aforesaid Ecclesiastical Authorities could also propose another candidate, and the Government would give great importance to such a proposal, all the more as it would be a better way to govern with good judgment in this regard.”

<p>Other than the above-mentioned participation in the appointment of the mentioned teachers, the State recognized moreover the right of the Ordinaries to oversee, also by means of special Episcopal Commissions, ...

<p><em>VI. – The Church is authorized to administer its property freely</em>...

<p>VII. – The buildings and funds of the State that currently serve ecclesiastical purposes are transferred into property of the Church ...

<p><em>X. – The Religious Orders and Congregations</em>`	

<p>Mr. Hoffmann listened attentively to my exposition ...

<p>As to what concerns the Lyceums ...

<p>In departing, I expressed my lively hope that, despite the profound theoretical differences, a practical way might be found to govern appropriately the relations between Church and State in Bavaria and I demonstrated to Mr. Hoffmann how that would succeed in ...

<p>I would therefore be most grateful to Your Eminence if you would deign to have sent to me with the <em>greatest possible expedition</em> the instructions that you may deem appropriate in Your superior judgment. Meanwhile I am continuing to pay attention also to the activity of some among the better Catholic Deputies of the <em>Bavarian Volkspartei</em>, whose attention I have focused upon yet another point of capital importance for the future of the Church in Bavaria, namely the teacher training schools or <em>Lehrerseminare</em>, where future teachers are formed. It is a very sad fact that young instructors who emerge from these institutes are for the most part of radical ideas and tendencies, which constitutes a most serious danger for the future education of youth in Bavaria. And the matter is of all the more urgent concern in that Mr. Hoffmann, who with stubborn obstinacy pursues his deleterious work in the schools issue, has recently reported as the official (Referent) in the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs responsible for the aforesaid teacher training institutes, Mr. Vogelhuber, a Socialist, and as I am told, an extremely radical one.

<blockquote>I have received encrypted cable 195.  Today, pursuant to his invitation, I had a colloquy with the Minister of Foreign Affairs; he discussed with me the question of parish patronato; article 137, section 3, of the Reich constitution concerning the free appointment to ecclesiastical offices is not yet in effect, as it needs to be implemented by legislation in the individual States according to the last section of that article: and thus no Education Minister could put it into effect before now. He therefore proposes that until a definitive resolution of the question, the former right of State presentation remain as the formality, although as concerns the Bishops they will freely exercise the provision insofar as the Government will not present any candidate without the previous consent of the Bishop. I asked if this might constitute a precedent affecting the future resolution of this question.  He responded in the negative, saying he was prepared to accept a statement in this regard.  Since it is impossible to predict when there can be a definitive resolution, and with the parish administrators in vacant parishes not having parish stipends, which under current economic difficulties produces a grave disadvantage for the clergy, I ask Your Eminence to tell me if, as to the parish patronato, the Bavarian Bishops can proceed in the same way the Holy See has adopted for Prussian canons under dispatch 97515.

<blockquote>Re: A speech by Minister Hoffmann

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>I believe it my duty to bring to the attention of Your Most Reverend Eminence some passages of a speech given a few days ago by the Minister President, Mr. Hoffmann, at a meeting in Nuremberg, and published in the Socialist newspaper “Fränkische Tagespost.” Apparently the Minister wanted to respond to the magnificent dynamic speech given by the Archbishop of Munich to the Catholic Congress recently held in this city (about which I had the honor to report to Your Eminence by my respectful report No. 14552 dated October 28); but what he expressed is merely new evidence to illustrate his pertinaciously anti-religious position and activity.

<p>Thus Mr. Hoffmann said: “We find ourselves in the midst of a series of struggles. That these struggles are instigated by the other side (he had already spoken of the war the Democrats were conducting) is most clearly shown by the various Congresses held recently by the bourgeois parties. From these you could see how difficult is the situation of the Socialists in the Ministerial Cabinet. At the Congress of Catholics in Munich, Archbishop Faulhaber spoke in the tone that the priests desire for their political music. What should we conclude from this? Behind us there is a year of progressive agitation. What we could not attain in 20 years of difficult work, today, by the work of the revolution, in the course of one year, has become a fact. The old ideal of Socialism, the separation of Church and State and of Church and school stands at the center of the political struggle. Now we are preparing the way to achieve this ideal. Who among us ever believed that the separation of Church and State and of Church and school would not encounter the opposition of the entire organized force of Clericalism? The Catholic has before his eyes a grand ideal by which he lives. We can combat this ideal only if we well establish our ideal, the ideal of Socialism. In the Catholic Congress of Munich, Archbishop Faulhaber gave a presentation of this struggle when he placed in contradiction Socialism and Christianity! But that is false. We do not combat Christianity, the religion, for we have in our own ranks free thinkers and devoted Christians. Our struggle is directed against the domination of the priests and the question we pose is this: ‘Socialism or clericalism!’  What is endangered is not religion, but the dominion of priests!  But religion is what they always put forward when assaults advance against the power of clericalism.  It was thus and not otherwise 2000 years ago. Indeed Jesus of Nazareth fought against the clerical caste. The speakers at the Catholic Congress, Professor Beyerle, Privy Councilor Marx and Archbishop Faulhaber used pretty catchwords to claim their right to Kulturkampf!”... [ellipsis in the original]

<blockquote>Re: Program for the formation of a monarchist party in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Here-enclosed I have the honor to send to Your Most Reverend Eminence a program for the formation of a monarchist party in Bavaria. The author, Mr. F. Mayer-Koy, a Bavarian official, who gave me this program and interested me in it, says that because of the most deplorable unfortunate conditions of the past year in Bavaria, a great many harbor a passionate desire for the past and a great number of men and women have come together for the formation of a Bavarian monarchist party: “Bayerische Königspartei.”

<p>The party says it proposes the liberation of Bavaria from the Prussian domination to which it is subjected today, by being reduced to a mere province, and at the same time the liberation of all Germany.  Bavaria is to return to being under the reign of the House of Wittelsbach, but in a manner corresponding to the modern liberal principles of public law.  The ministers are to be appointed by the King, but left with the power that has recently lost the trust of the people. The elections to the Chamber of representatives of the people (<em>Volkskammer</em>) are to be done according to a proportional system, with universal suffrage equally for men and women, and all from the age of 40 would have a double vote. Moreover another Chamber of representatives of the various social classes (<em>Ständekammer</em>) would be constituted, in which would be applied in a fruitful manner the Council system (<em>Rätegedanke</em>).  All of this is summarized in the mottos “A Free Bavaria in a free Germany” and “A free people under a free King.”  It is explained then that the new monarchy and in general the government and popular education are to be founded on these religious and moral principles.  These principles would have to be Christian, but it is expressly stated that the new party will not serve any special confession and will allow its members, like all citizens, full freedom of conscience. It therefore proposes the complete renunciation of the old regalism and the recognition of the fullest faculties for religious societies with autonomous administration of their affairs. The State is to assume a benevolent attitude toward religion and be most ready, in an equitable manner, to carry out its obligations toward the aforesaid religious societies, assuring them the possibility of living by means of the exaction of church taxes.  These principles find their expression in a motto like Cavour’s, “Free Church in a free State.”  The program in question seeks, in sum, to resolve the school problem, combatting the uniformity of public schooling and recognizing for parents the fullest freedom of instruction for their children in what concerns the private school: “Free School for free parents.”

<p>The other articles of the program concern economic issues.

<p>What might be the effective political value of this program , and what hopes the creation of the new party might have, it is not easy to say with certainty; also according to information I have as of now, it cannot be given much importance. Undoubtedly from many quarters there is talk of an agitation in a monarchical sense, but it is very questionable whether this is the opportune time for such a movement, and thus it is prudent to receive with all reserve both the above-described program and the party that might perhaps be born from it.

<p>Arriving unsung and unheralded in Prague is new Archbishop Kordac from Rome, who is also a well-disposed man toward the Germans. He is a student of the German Jesuits from our Collegium Germanicum [seminary in Rome].  Much work and struggle await him.  Czech President Masaryk, a Freemason for years and a raging fighter against the Catholic Church, is promoting, in association with his American Jewish wife and their correspondingly raised daughter, all the efforts toward apostasy: members of Religious orders are being expelled, monasteries and Church property confiscated, etc.  But now, finally, the resistance has stepped up.  1100 protest gatherings on a single day were held by the Catholic people.  Prague witnessed a massive gathering of 50,000 persons, yet all of this was suppressed by our infiltrated international telegraph offices. Concerning the demands of some long-since rotten priests for the abrogation of celibacy, the Pope obviously instructed the new Archbishop to reject them absolutely...

<p>In Hungary the storm has passed over. It tore off some rotten branches, but far fewer than many had thought.  The Hungarian Catholics displayed heroic courage, which the Pope then appropriately recognized and praised in a letter to Cardinal Czernoch of Gran (Esztergom, Hungary). The Pastor of Nikisch, who offered himself to the Bolsheviks in place of the father of a family who was condemned to death, and then was shot dead; Bishop Mikesch, who was humiliated by three months in prison as a common criminal; thousands who thronged to the Church and the sacraments despite all prohibitions; women among the people who placed themselves as human barriers in front of the threatened monasteries; and hundreds of other examples deserve to be made particularly known. Where such a spirit lives in the people, we do not fear for their future.  Might I single out just one example, because it is so beautiful.  The people’s delegate and liquidator for Church affairs, Faber, a fallen away cleric and bloody man like [Hungarian Communist Tibor] Szamuely, rushed into a girls’ school to control the instruction and asked that a student be quizzed on history.  The 16 year old girl who was called out freely gave a glowing talk on patriotism and piety in Faber’s presence. Faber, white with rage, addressed her: “Comrade girl, do you know that I have the right, based on what you said, to have you hanged immediately?”  The girl, the daughter of a respected family, replied: “I know that, but I do not fear you. If you have me hanged, I will pray in the next world for your conversion.” Pale and shaking, even this ruthless tyrant had to admit: “Such a character have I never before seen in my life” - and with that he left the school. That is the spirit that conquers even Bolshevism! ...

In all other garrison locations, chaplaincy in the Army will have to be a part of civilian pastoral care, as provided according to Art. 140 and 141 of the Reich Constitution. I may certainly count on the agreement of the Most Reverend Lord Bishops as I express myself to the Lord Cardinal of Cologne and the local Reich Army Command with the statement, “the Military Chaplaincy in Bavaria may under no circumstances be placed under the jurisdiction of the Prussian Military Chaplain, rather the Military Chaplains remain under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of the locality.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Memorandum of the Fulda Bishops Conference to the Reich Government”

<p>Exalted Reich Government!

<p>The most devoted undersigned Archbishops and Bishops of Germany consider themselves obligated by conscience to take a position on the Constitution of the German Reich of August 11, 1919 by the following statement.

<p>The Catholic Church is an institution that rests upon its divine institution by Jesus Christ and its rights, as such were conferred upon her by her divine founder and flow from her divine foundation, cannot be subjected to worldly legislative bounds and limitations. We gladly acknowledge that the new Reich Constitution in certain fields brings with it greater freedom for the activity of the Catholic Church for the good of our hard-pressed people.  On the other hand, some provisions are nevertheless to be found, to our painful regret, which mean an intrusion into the inalienable rights of the Church. Among such provisions are:

<p>Art. 10, No. 1, where the Reich imputes to itself the authority to set up principles, by way of legislation, for the rights and duties of the Church;

<p>Art. 137, where with the passage, “Every religious society orders and administers its affairs independently, within the limitations of generally applicable law,” confers upon the State the right to intrude on occasion into the affairs of the Church, even in the most private and essential matters.

<p>Art. 138, where the Reich is declared competent to set up unilaterally, without involvement of the Church, governing principles for the event of possible dissolution of state subsidies to the Church that are grounded in law, treaty or particular title of right.

<p>Art. 143-149, which contain various provisions about instruction and education of youth, which on the one hand are not compatible with the rights of the Church (compare the relevant canons of the Code of Canon Law) and those responsible for child-rearing, in particular the parents, and which on the other hand confer upon the State far too extensive powers, among others an unrestricted right of oversight of the Church’s religious instruction in the school, not only of the external ordering of it in the curriculum and teaching plan.

<p>Against these and all the provisions of the new Reich Constitution that are injurious to the rights of the Church, we submit our solemn protest on the strength of our office. In doing this we gratefully acknowledge what has been done by members of the National Assembly, in defense of Church principles, for the improvement and completion of the original outline of the Constitution.

<p>As to what concerns the oath to be administered under the Constitution, Catholics will obviously not be able to be obligated to anything that contradicts a divine or Church law and thereby violates their conscience. That corresponds to the freedom of conscience that is solemnly guaranteed to all inhabitants of the German Reich in Art. 135.

<p>Proceeding from the Christian principle that State and Church are two powers willed by God, each independent in its own field and thus having equal rights, we might give expression to our conviction that a peaceful agreement between the responsible leading posts in State and Church concerning the various articles of the new Constitution of the German Reich that we had to protest might be allowed to come to pass.</blockquote>

It also contained praise for Councilor Adolf Braun and especially for Rev. Giovanni Evangelista Müller.

<p>Together with this letter, Baron von Cramer-Klett presented two general certificates from the same Archdiocesan Ordinariate for Rev. Giuseppe Jud and Gioacchino Pölzl.  He then had confidence to explain the desire of the Archbishop, beseeching for the first seven persons (one of which is actually not named) the Cross pro Ecclesia et Pontifice, for the two priests Müller and Jud the title of Supernumerary Privy Chamberlain, and for Rev. Pölzl the dignity of Domestic Prelate.

<p>The Holy Father, before making a determination in this regard, desires to have opportune information from You and to know, even more, the explicit and concrete desire of the Archbishop.

<blockquote>Your Excellency!

<p>Most reverend Herr Archbishop!

<p>As is well known, by the Revolution and by the new constitutions of the Reich and of the Bavarian State, which have been recently published, a new situation has been created, so that there is a need to settle the relations between Church and State in Bavaria in a new agreement.

<p>For this purpose, I have put together several points, keeping in view the already expressed demands of the most reverend Bavarian Bishops, which should provide the articles for the future agreement, and which I have already expressed in a discussion with Herr Minister President on October 30th of this year. These points were submitted by me to the Holy See and were completely approved by the same, and I have receiving instructions to strive toward having these points find acceptance with the Bavarian Government. Nonetheless I consider it appropriate to share these hereby confidentially with Your Excellency and to request devotedly, if you have any special desires in relation to them, that you make them known to me without delay.

<p>1. The Church freely appoints to Church positions without involvement of the State and the civic Communities. The State will also provide its subsidies in the future as previously, including the so-called free-will ones, and these latter will be included in the overall accounting.

<p>2. For the appointment of professors to the theological faculties of the universities, the State will make a recommendation of one or several suitable candidates to the Ordinary of the Diocese, whose agreement is necessary for the appointment. Also, in the philosophy faculty of each university there must be at least one professor of true philosophy and one professor for history whose Church standpoint is sound in the judgment of the Ordinary.

<p>3. The lyceums for the philosophical and theological formation of priests are Diocesan institutions and as such dependent on the Ordinary, who freely appoints the rectors and professors.

<p>4. If a university professor is considered unfit by the Ordinary on account of his teaching activity or on account of his moral conduct, he is to be removed.

<p>5. Likewise the religion teachers in middle schools are appointed upon recommendation of the Ordinary and will, upon complaint by the same, be removed for the reasons set forth above.

<p>6. The Church is entitled to freedom to administer its property. The Church has the right to raise taxes from her members and to dispose freely of the proceeds thereof. The State will raise such taxes together with State taxes in return for reasonable compensation.

<p>7. The buildings and real estate of the State that currently serve Church purposes directly or indirectly shall be transferred into property of the Church; the currently obligatory State duties of construction and maintenance of such buildings will be suitably discharged.

<p>8. The State must recognize and as necessary implement the decrees of the supreme Church authorities within the ecclesiastical realm.

<p>9. With the army, and in penal institutions, caring institutions and hospitals, a regular system of pastoral care will be established and the State will provide for it the necessary financial means as well as the required rooms, utensils and vestments.

<p>10. Orders and Congregations may be freely founded and have legal capacity according to the laws applicable to all citizens and societies; they are independent with respect to the State in the ordering and administration of their affairs. Their property and their other rights are guaranteed.

<blockquote>Your Excellency!

<p>Most reverend Herr Archbishop!

<p>I have the honor to answer Your Excellency’s gracious letter of Nov. 27 as follows:

<p>1. If the Lord Nuncio has the impression as though we Bishops were dissatisfied with the provisional arrangement for appointments to parishes, it is certainly not my fault. I am glad that this matter has found a solution, and I have never said otherwise. I have recently just expressed to Your Excellency the fear that the Minister might now consider putting off the final resolution, but I am not in the least dissatisfied with the interim arrangement on that account.

<p>2. The Fulda declaration is in my opinion not a “protest” against the German Reich Constitution, as has been maintained. A “protest” would have had to be made against the outline of the Constitution and a protest against the now finished Constitution would have something anti-State about it. The Fulda declaration is merely a precaution against certain articles of the Constitution being implemented without involvement of the Church, and it contains in its conclusion, to my delight, the assurance that an agreement with the Church is to be achieved in most of the points…

<p>3. I have already authorized Your Excellency to make a later statement in my name as well against Stahler’s State League of Diocesan Priest Associations…

<p>4 and 5. Today I received the 10 points shared by the Lord Nuncio, which, as approved by the Holy See, should be the foundation for Concordat negotiations, and which the Nuncio already indeed on October 30th discussed with the Minister President. The points contain throughout strict Canon Law. Since there were already approved by the Holy See and made known to Hoffmann, the delegates will not be able to do anything but accept them as “substance” and “instructions.” We Bishops also cannot give any other instructions under such circumstances, and I consider even the introduction of the commission as a delicate matter. If the commission lets one or another of the 10 points fall by the wayside because hopeless in full session, then the fault falls upon the Bishops, that they did not hold to the instructions of the Holy See. As to the members of the commission that Your Excellency has in mind, I would have absolutely no reservations, but to give them or Dr. Heim any other instructions than the Nuncio’s 10 points would be wrong in my view…

<p>6, 7 and 8. I took notice of this with satisfaction and I express my special thanks to Your Excellency for the concern in the matter of the bell-ringing. I am still being severely attacked, disconsolate over the development of things, and many days almost unable to work. Commending myself therefore to Your Excellency’s prayers, I remain Your

<a name="35b"></a><p><strong>Dec. 3, 1919</strong> Kiefl to Faulhaber:

<blockquote>Your Excellency,

<p>most reverend Herr Archbishop

<p>most gracious Herr!

<p>The State Secretary in the Education Ministry, Saenger, issued in the press a declaration about cultural policy in Bavaria, in which he attacked Your Excellency’s Munich Catholic Congress speech. Unfortunately the Foreword to the second edition of my “Sozialismus und Religion” has already been printed. Otherwise I would have still highlighted Saenger’s speech there. In this Foreword I have called Your Excellency’s speech the most important event and the most courageous deed in German Catholicism since the outbreak of the Revolution, and I would like to express, without flattery, my most reverential thanks for it to Your Excellency. Into the entire Catholic world, it has finally brought back a vital energizing momentum that allows us to forge hope once again.

<p>This fact allows me to venture a respectful request. In the Concordat issue a great confusion reigns. Herr Prelate Hollweck has aggravated it by issuing a declaration that the Concordat is broken because Bavaria is no longer an independent state.

<p>I have occupied myself to some extent with these matters and feared that such concepts would cause enormous harm. In my opinion one should have held fast to the Concordat’s validity. Otherwise we would have no foundation any more for the entitlements of the Church. In any case the matter has enormous difficulties. Therefore it would be best to demand a revision of the Concordat. One can bring under the rubric “revision” everything that is to be demanded in the interest of the Church. Only if the Concordat is given up does the juridical question arise whether the Church’s entitlements can still be tied back to the secularization a hundred years later. This question is from a juridical perspective variously denied.

<p>Your Excellency, please do not take my most reverential presentation as if I wanted thereby to tell Your Excellency something new. But I would like to ask Your Excellency reverentially as well as privately to allow action so that the Concordat is not formally overturned but rather revised. The Church’s capacity for action would thereby in my opinion be significantly strengthened. Otherwise I would fear a radical separation of Church and State, in a manner known from other countries.  Then what would become of the Church in Bavaria?

<p>In the papers (Regensburger Anzeiger) it said that Your Excellency had taken up the initiative to arrange a provisional way that the parish positions could be filled again. So far as I can see, and I have heard many clerics about this, people are extraordinarily grateful to Your Excellency for this. Frankly there are higher authorities that now want everything separated from the state for the sake of the Church’s freedom.  It may be that I am deceiving myself. For I would fear that this way does not lead to the goal.

<p>Your Excellency, please pardon me if with these lines I venture to impose a burden. But the hope of the Bavarian Catholics now depends completely on the person of Your Excellency.

<a name="35c"></a><p><strong>Dec. 4, 1919</strong> Faulhaber to Kiefl:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Cathedral Deacon!

<p>The supreme pastoral authority in Munich takes the standpoint that the Concordat, despite some holes that political developments and the Education Minister have made in it, still by law exists and must form the basis for further negotiations. For this concept, that the Concordat still exists for us, we have made great sacrifices and have still not claimed for ourselves the benefit of Article 137 Section 3 of the Reich Constitution up to this day. Also, after the disappearance of the monarchy, the desire of the Holy Father that the Nunciature might continue to exist in Munich would have no sense or foundation in law if the Concordat no longer exists or will no longer exist in some kind of form.

<p>The dissolution negotiations will take shape in a much more favorable way for the Church if the validity of the Concordat is recognized and the accommodation of the Concordat’s rights and burdens to the new state of affairs is carried out by direct negotiations between the Government and the Apostolic See and not handed over to the partisan wrangling of the Landtag. The Lord Nuncio stands so firmly on this standpoint that he had the text of the 10 negotiating points approved to him by the Vatican Secretary of State, so that for any amendment to them he must receive new instructions. Now he wants nothing whatsoever to be spoken about this in public; on the other hand the Minister President is seeking to introduce the key point of the negotiations in the Landtag.

<p>To make advance preparations on this issue, to the extent we are in light of the aforesaid authorized at all for that, we have set up a commission and have also invited the esteemed Cathedral Deacon of Regensburg to it (Address: Vicar General Dr. Buchberger, Munich, Sendlinger St. 63). With public statements like that of Prelate Hollweck, matters are not helped at this time. The freedom of the Church, nevertheless, we hope to save, because even the new shaping of the Concordat can only move in the direction of the phrase of the Reich Constitution, “There is no state church.”

<p>I would be delighted to be able to speak with you sometime soon about these burning issues.

<blockquote>Dearest Brother ... As you may have read in the newspapers, to combat Bolshevism, which ruled here last April, given the insufficiency of the few troops that Germany is still allowed to maintain under the peace treaty, a civil guard called the <em>Einwohnerwehr</em> was formed, very well organized, which has been truly indispensable to hold the Communists at bay. But now Clemenceau, at the suggestion of Marshal Foch, has commanded Germany to dissolve it. I had occasion, today, to speak not only with a <em>diplomat</em> (the Prussian chargé d'affaires) and with a German parliamentary delegate (the Head of the Bavarian Center Party), but also with Captain De Luca, attaché with the <em>Italian</em> Military Mission in Berlin, who have said very seriously that if the commanded suppression of this guardian of security takes place, Bolshevism will inevitably return, especially in Munich, and in <em>a much more grave and lasting form</em> than last April.  I, being already accused of being fearful, have written nothing of all this to Rome, because it would be wrongly interpreted and moreover no one can predict the future with absolute certainty.  But I wanted to write this to you, so that if you see (what is unfortunately almost beyond doubt) this evaluation to be confirmed, you can speak with Card. Gasparri, because it is clear to me what I must do. I have already been in imminent mortal danger, and I do not know how a second time will turn out, but <em>I am ready for anything</em>, provided it is made known to me in a clear manner what is wanted of me, and without conditions like this “<em>if there is danger</em>.” As I learned from a German gentleman who returned from Rome today, they do not believe in the danger of the situation in Germany.  It is said in the Vatican that the German people are a people of order, a disciplined people; and this would be true, if the Entente would permit and allow the means to resist the numerous powerful revolutionary elements.  It is true that also in Italy there are dangers and I have followed with great anxiety the events of recent days; but there the Government and the parties of order can defend themselves, since there is no one who makes them dissolve the guardians of security.  If you will speak with Card. Gasparri in the sense indicated, I ask you to do it in a way that does not appear to have been suggested by me.  You might be able to say that I wrote about the situation here in a <em>narrative</em> manner and that our worried family is asking that the Holy See think of me in this way.  In any case, I have written this matter to you and I am sure that you will do everything for the best.  But you will be able to understand how, despite everything, this state of continuous anxiety is certainly not helpful for healing my stomach!...</blockquote>

Ma ora Clemenceau, su proposta del Maresciallo Foch, ha intimato alla Germania di scioglierla. Ho avuto occasione, oggi, di parlare non solo con un <em>diplomatico</em> (l'Incaricato d’affari di Prussia) e con un parlamentare tedesco (il Capo del Centro bavarese), ma anche col Capitano De Luca, distaccato dalla Missione <em>italiana</em> militare di Berlino, i quali tutti seri hanno detto che, se la intimata soppressione di quella guardia di sicurezza avrà luogo, tornerà inevitabilmente il bolscevismo, specialmente in Monaco, ed <em>in forma assai più grave e duratura</em> che nell’aprile scorso.  Io, essendo già accusato di paura, non scrivo nulla di tutto ciò a Roma, perché sarebbe male interpretato ed inoltre nessuno può predire con assoluta certezza l’avvvenire.  Ma ho voluto scriverlo a te, affinché, se vedrai che (com’è pur troppo quasi fuori di dubbio) quella misura si verificherà, possa parlare col Card. Gasparri, perché mi si dica in modo chiaro che cosa debbo fare.  Io già sono stato in pericolo imminente di vita, e non so se una seconda volta ne uscirò salvo, ma <em>son pronto a tutto</em>, purché mi si faccia conoscere in modo chiaro, e senza condizioni come questa “<em>se v’è pericolo</em>,” che cosa si vuole da me.  Come ho saputo da un Signore tedesco tornato ora da Roma, costì non si crede ai pericoli della situazione in Germania.  Si dice in Vaticano che il popolo tedesco è un popolo d’ordine, un popolo disciplinato; e questo sarebbe vero, se l’Intesa permettesse e lasciasse i mezzi per resistere ai numerosi e potenti elementi rivoluzionari.  E vero che anche in Italia vi sono pericoli e io ho seguito con molta angustia gli avvenimenti di questi giorni; ma costì il Governo ed i partiti di ordine possono difendersi, giacché non vi è nessuno che viene loro a sciogliere le guardie di sicurezza.  Se tu parlerai col Card. Gasparri nel senso suddetto, ti prego di farlo in modo che non apparisca che sia stato suggerito da me.  Potresti dire che io ho scritto della situazione di qui in maniera <em>narrativa</em> e che la famiglia preoccupata domanda che cosa pensi la S. Sede di me.  In ogni modo, io ho scritto a te della cosa e son sicuro che tu farai tutto per la meglio.

<p>The following pastoral word of warning against the bad press [<em>die schlechte Presse</em>] is to be read annually on the 2nd Sunday of Advent from the pulpit to the faithful, after the Gospel, at the early masses and at the high mass.
   
<p>Dear faithful, 
   
<p>We have the earnest and holy obligation to warn you of aspects of these new times that pose a severe and immediate danger to your faith and moral life.
   
<p>By this we mean the excesses of a press that often fights against the teachings of our Holy Catholic Church and violates good morals.  Reading such material in the press is a sin against the faith and against the Lord’s commandments.  That is why it is a matter of holy obligation of conscience for us to warn you about this, and a holy obligation of conscience for you to listen to this warning voice of your supreme shepherds.  
   
<p>All of you know that holy faith, this highest good and noblest jewel of the soul, for which the greatest men of the Church have given their blood and life, can be lost through your own guilt.  You incur such guilt, with full severe responsibility before God and your <a href="inotesii1.html#ii150">conscience</a>, whenever you allow newspapers and magazines into your home and your family, which try to undo your faith, your respect and love for the Church and its servants; publications containing writings and pictures that are actually scornful of Christian morality.  You will bring scandal and seduction to your own children if you passively tolerate the way such newspapers and magazines, with their style that is sometimes repulsively raw, sometimes seductively attractive, desecrate day by day the sanctuary of your families.
   
<p>We ask and adjure you: Do not allow the terrible woe declared by our Lord and Savior for those who give scandal, to come upon your head!  Listen therefore to the voice of your bishops, whose concern for the salvation of your souls obliges them to give this word of warning!  Prevent the entry into your home of all newspapers, magazines, calendars, books, brochures, etc., that have the purpose of undermining faith and morals, respect for the authority of Church and State.
    
<p>Remember the admonition of the Lord: “Whoever hears you, hears me; whoever despises you, despises me.”

<p>Note: The <em>Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung</em> looks quite similar to diocesan weeklies in the English-speaking world today, with a combination of religious articles, news about the Vatican and Catholic Church developments in other countries, current events from a Catholic perspective, parish Sunday mass schedules, and announcements and reports about events of parishes and associations in the archdiocese, including talks and appearances by Munich’s Archbishop Michael von Faulhaber.  The paper still exists today under the title <em>Münchener Kirchenzeitung</em> [Munich Church Newspaper].

<blockquote>“Followers of Christ the Lord!”

   <p>From every pulpit in Bavaria rings out today the pastoral word of warning of the Archbishops and Bishops against the bad press.  The entire Bavarian episcopate are pursuing, with this urgent warning and heartfelt request of theirs, no other goal than that of Pope Pius X of blessed memory in his apostolic motto: <em>Omni instaurare in Christo</em>, “Restore all things in Christ.”  This papal and episcopal wake-up call will produce an especially strong echo among the more than 200,000 members (individuals and entities) of the Catholic Press Association for Bavaria.  This Catholic Press Association is not a political association, but rather a purely religious association marked by special indulgences.  It stands under the special protection of St. Michael the Archangel and has the goal, like its sister foundations in Hungary, Serbia, South Russia, Spain, Brazil, Japan and North America, of promoting Catholic press and literature to the greatest extent and defending the Catholic people from irreligious and immoral literature.  In 600 places in Bavaria such Press Associations have already been founded with their own youth- and peoples-libraries, and there is hardly a parish in Bavaria that does not have at least some members of this Association that is so warmly recommended by all Popes and all the Bishops of Bavaria.  But it is not only the 200,000 members of the Press Association who will be newly roused by today’s pastoral letter and will feel newly enlivened to energetic further activity.  Every Catholic, whether man or woman, right from today, must recognize what a severe urgency this renewal in Christ places upon us in view of the evident devastation by the bad press.  Every Catholic must also, however, out of love for immortal human souls, make use of the means of renewal in Christ, every Catholic must himself become an apostle of the press, first in his own family, and then also among all his acquaintances.  It is no coincidence that the same man who adopted the phrase <em>Omnia instaurare in Christo</em>, Pope Pius X of blessed memory, also declared that cooperation in the press apostolate of the Press Association is a “good work of the highest priority.”

   <p>Followers of the Lord!  If we have had cause to complain in recent years and decades of a falling away from Christ, from the Christian spirit, from Christian morals, it is not least the bad press that bears the blame.  French President Combes himself admitted: “the pallid anti-Christian press is the reason that France has become two-thirds to three-quarters de-Christianized.”  Equally among us in Germany and everywhere in the world, the awful accusation must be raised against the bad press, that it has injected, fed and promoted religious doubt among the people, and in this way has brought thousands upon thousands to fall away from the faith and turn away from Christ.  It willfully suppresses everything that is beautiful and great in the Catholic faith and in Catholic life.  Of such matters it either tells its readers absolutely nothing, or reports about the matters in a completely distorted way.  And this press is celebrating absolute orgies right in our day.  If in previous times such shameless doings were subject to at least some restriction by law, so that the flood of smut could be somewhat held back, so today in the free people’s state this plague from the press is allowed to spread unhindered and poison the people even in the remotest areas.  They are content to watch how nicely the youth, caught up in this plague, wither away and are driven to their destruction.  These plague-bearers are criminals against the people, they are those of whom the Savior spoke, saying to fear those who can cast body and soul into eternal damnation.

   <p>It is a genocide in the worst sense of the word that is going on here right under the eye of the law, and actually under the protection of the law.  We are horrified over the victims of the War.  But the victims of the press-plague leave even these in the shadows.  Perhaps many will think that I am seeing things too darkly, that I could be exaggerating – one glance at the type of literature that is on offer, as a result of the lifting of press censorship, with the help, that is, of the law, speaks for itself, one glance at the activity in the major cities will bring you to the conviction that I am right and that words do not suffice to describe the press-plague and its consequences.

   <p>Beloved in the Lord!  You will ask:  how is it possible, and how can the press have such impact?  The answer lies in the absolutely tremendous power of the written word.  That is what explains the great power position of the press.  We know the power of the spoken word, how it can enthuse and sweep people along.  We have already often heard the echo that a call arouses in the hearts of men; but this echo often resounds without perceptible result.  These are sudden effects that mostly disappear with equal suddenness.  Not so with the written word.  Its impact is slower, but all the more lasting, because it is called back to mind and retained by repeated reading.  And the written word penetrates in many places where the spoken word cannot.  Into the remotest corner of an attic the written word preaches in whatever form the press produces.  And there it can work every hour of the day and night – always and everywhere.  The zone of impact of the written word knows no limits and its potential impact is unlimited.  This can, moreover, turn out for good or evil.  And if we must speak of a press-plague, then we can also speak of a press-blessing.  As far as the bad press reaches and sows destruction, just so far can the good press also work and impart blessing.  And that is why I perceive precisely in the good press a first-rate means for universal renewal in Christ.
 
  <p>Beloved in the Lord!  Whoever wants to cooperate energetically here must become an apostle of the press.  Yes, I would like to say that no one who has an interest in the souls of men can pass by the press-apostolate without taking part.  And this apostolate really summons everyone without exception to take up the opportunity – some more, others less, but everyone something.  But in this apostolate we need deeds above all.  Words do not do much; that has been proven well enough by the past.  Our activity here must be two-fold – both negative and positive.  The one solution is this: Out with the bad press in every form – daily newspaper, magazine with or without 
illustrations, or book!  For all of that there is only one word, “Out!”  Do it mercilessly, even if we have to forgo access half a day earlier to some novelty, even if we miss the latest joke of the day, even if we are considered “backwards.”  Frankly, it is a matter of religious courage to declare openly: “I will not stand for this newspaper, even if half the city stands for it,” or “I will not read this book, even if good breeding demands it.”  Can we really not summon up enough courage to remain true to our own principles?  There are, most unfortunately, not a few Catholics whose Catholic foundations are completely abandoned when it comes to the press.  Here a lack of character becomes evident, which makes us blush with shame.  Here the renewal in Christ places urgent demands on us, in Christ who so sharply condemned indecision and lukewarmness:  “whoever is not for me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me, scatters.”  “O, that you were cold or hot!  But since you are lukewarm, neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.”  Let us apostles of the press drive out such products of the press whenever we bump into them!  Frankly we must not be satisfied with just this negative work; we must also, at the same time, make way for the good press.  Indeed we have allowed talk of the alleged “backwardness” of Catholics for so long, letting ourselves be talked into an entirely false modesty, that it has become almost a dogma for us.  One of those many prejudices that proceed from a lack of Catholic self-confidence!  But even if we once had to renounce something: “what good is it to a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?”  And if we once could rightly complain, must we not beat our breast in shame and acknowledge: <em>mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</em> – through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault?  No, we owe it to our Catholic press, to our Catholic writers, to support them with all means at our disposal.  (footnote:  And we have a lack of good newspapers, which could also cooperate with each other by means of telegraph, and which always stand up full and well for matters of our Catholic Church and our Catholic schools.  A Catholic newspaper belongs in every Catholic home.  In Munich, however, other than the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em> [Bavarian Courier], the <em>Neue Münchener Tagblatt</em> [New Munich Daily], and <em>Das Bayerische Vaterland</em> [Bavarian Fatherland], there are generally no daily newspapers that lay claim to the honorable title of “Catholic.”  Note from the Editor.)

   <p>Followers of the Lord!  We can hardly imagine the blessing that we impart through the expansion of the good press.  The apostle of the press can be compared to the sower in the Gospel, who sows seed in good soil, where it then yields hundredfold fruit.  The apostle of the press has received his mission from the Savior himself in the words: “Teach all peoples!”  In his hands, the dead letter comes alive and the book receives life and hurries out as friend, as fighter, as admonisher, as comforter.  Through the apostle of the press the written word finds its way everywhere:  into the dwellings of the rich and the garrets of the destitute, into the hands of the educated and unlearned, onto the beds of the sick and to children.  And wherever it has arrived, it has served as a guardian angel and has spread light and life.

   <p>Beloved in the Lord!  How can I motivate you to indefatigable work in the press apostolate?  I need only point out that this work is a work for the souls of men, for the souls for whom Christ poured out his blood on the wood of the cross.  To be an apostle means:  to win souls for Christ.  Whoever saves even just one single soul through the press apostolate had done more than if he had distributed immeasurable riches among the poor.  Yes, he has accomplished the work of salvation and stilled God’s heartstrings:

<blockquote>A priest’s heart is Jesus’ heart,

<p>And souls are his only craving,

<p>For souls his heart suffers death and pain,

<p>For souls it is consumed by love.</blockquote>

  <p>I appeal to you, Catholic men and women, get to work for salvation through the press!  Renewal in Christ is done through the apostolate of the press.  St. Michael is our leader.  Once, at the call of the Lord, he led the battle in the heavenly realms with his host of angels against Satan and his minions and forever defeated them.  Today again the battle is against Satan, against Satan’s work in the bad press, against Satan’s servants who poison our people.  But today we are the ones who enlist in Michael’s legion and fight under his leadership – and conquer.

   <p> “St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle!  Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.  May God rebuke him, we earnestly pray.  And may you, prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who roam about the world seeking the destruction of souls!  Amen.”

   <p>Albert Graf [Count] von Preysing</blockquote>

<p>Note: The author, a priest named Count Albert von Preysing, hailed from a prominent family of the Bavarian nobility.  His brother Konrad later became Cardinal-Bishop of Berlin.  The “Preysing Palace” can still be seen today at Munich’s Odeonplatz, beside the Feldherrnhalle, across the street from the former Residence of the royal house of Wittelsbach.

<p>An article immediately after Father Count Preysing’s added an antisemitic twist to the overall exhortation, making the outlandish claim that “nearly three-fourths of German newspapers are in the hands of Jews”:

<p>“An Earnest Word about an Earnest Matter” 

<p>In Bavaria we have about 3,000 Catholic parishes and only about 600 open public youth libraries and people’s libraries of the Catholic Press Association for Bavaria.  Even if we include the few so-called parish libraries, the great portion of parishes are without any public library.

   <p>How long do we want to keep waiting before we establish a library in every place, even in the smallest village?  We have reached the point in Germany and Bavaria where the number of newspapers has taken off, yet we are faced with the really shameful fact that, as established by the literary historian Barel, nearly ¾ of German newspapers are in the hands of Jews.  And if those in position to safeguard Catholic faith and Christian morals in Bavaria do not immediately take hold of the situation, we are very quickly going to be faced with the horrendous fact that the majority of libraries even in Bavaria will be in the hands of Jews, Freemasons and Social Democrats.  Because these people are working, and they are working all-out...</p>

<p>The Catholic Press Association for Bavaria [<em>Katholischer Pressverein für Bayern</em>] was founded in 1901.  The key figure in the Association from 1912 to 1932, as General Secretary and General Director, was a priest named Ludwig Müller, not to be confused with Reich Bishop Ludwig Müller of the Nazi regime, or with Ludwig Müller von Hausen, the publisher of the first German edition of the <em>Protocols</em>. 

<p>The Bavarian Historical Lexicon states that as of 1920, the Catholic Press Association was the “most significant popular educational association in Bavaria.”  “Katholischer Pressverein für Bayern,” <em>Historisches Lexikon Bayerns</em>, www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns. De/artikel/artikel_44741, visited March 11, 2013.  With a membership of 200,000 Catholics, this association served as the publishing house for the <em>Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung</em> and a multitude of other Catholic papers throughout Bavaria.

<p>Pope St. Pius X’s promotion of the “good press” and condemnation of the “bad press” can be seen in his statement published in the <em>Croce</em> of Naples at Easter of 1907:

<blockquote>In face of unrestrained license of the anti-Catholic press, which impugns or denies eternal laws of truth and justice, which stirs up hatred against the Church, which insinuates into people’s hearts most pernicious doctrines, corrupting minds, fostering evil appetites, flattering the senses and perverting the will – all ought to recognize the great importance of union between good people for turning to advantage of the Church and society a weapon the enemy uses to injure both.</blockquote>

<p>The terminology of “good press” was also current in France, where the “House of the Good Press” published a mass-circulation Catholic daily, <em>La Croix</em>, beginning in the 1870s, and a weekly compilation of documents from the Vatican and the Catholic hierarchy of France and other countries, <em>La Documentation Catholique</em>, beginning in 1919.  Bavaria after World War I was more fertile ground than secularized France for a focused initiative to limit Catholic readers to an approved set of publications.</p><br>

<p>Having now inquired in this regard of Monsignor von Faulhaber, he has made known to me that he implores 1st) for Father Jakob Poelzl, Ecclesiastic Councilor, Deacon of the Parish of Garmisch, the title of Domestic Prelate; 2nd) for Father Dr. Johann Evangelist Mueller and Pastor Joseph Jud the title of Supernumerary Privy Chamberlain; 3rd) for Councilor Adolf Braun and for Mrs. Berta Schaefer the Cross pro Ecclesia et Pontifice; 4th) Finally for Madams Anna Spitzer, Emma Mahler, Caterina Sepp, for Secretary Fr. Ludwig Hennerfeind and for Judge Karl Landes, the Archbishop, not daring to claim for these also the Cross pro Ecclesia et Pontifice, although it would be merited by their work for youth, limits himself to imploring the Apostolic Benediction and possibly some momento of Rome, as for example a blessed image of the Holy Father’s tiara.

<blockquote>Re: Concerning an ecclesiastical consultant in the German Embassy being established at the Holy See

<p>Most Reverend Eminence:

<p>I was able to read a letter that the German Ambassador to Bern, Dr. Adolf Müller, recently sent to the Editor-in-Chief of the “Bayerischen Kurier.” In it the aforesaid Ambassador says he understands that once the German Embassy to the Vatican is created (a matter that, according to him, is delayed by a divergence of views between Mr. von Bergen and the Government in Berlin concerning the budget for the Ambassador), thought will be given to establishing a special office at the aforementioned Embassy to handle the press. Mr. Müller is turning to the Editor-in-Chief of the Bavarian Catholic daily paper and with a great sense of opportuneness is giving him to think it would be convenient that this office be occupied by a person who is not only expert in ecclesiastical matters, but also in favor with the Holy See, and he asks for a name.

<p>The aforesaid journalist and other persons as well would put forward the name of Prof. Father B.R. Stempfle and would believe it opportune that he assume also the office of ecclesiastical consultant to the Embassy. Father Stempfle would be known in the Vatican, having worked a great deal in the Vatican Archives.

<blockquote>I am happy to see you. I thank you for the care for our prisoners of war, who were very embittered. Yes really, but if we had only achieved something, but this Clemenceau! Brothers and fathers wanted to go into imprisonment for the others, but that was not accepted. We wanted to send priests at Christmas. I wanted an appeal, an open statement, but too few came.

<p>I thank you for the appeal to help the children. [footnote: cf. Benedict SV, <em>Paterno iam diu</em>] “Is the distress very great?” At the confirmations the children were pale. We no longer have this crying and bustling of children on the streets. For seminarians there are hardly any cassocks to be had. “Is it lack of money or lack of material?”

<p>The Government has other things to do: Not bread and coal and shoes, but rather policy about the schools. “Will the Catholic delegates really take a stand” and allow themselves to be advised by the Bishops? They think too much of their families, they need to be celibates and should make no compromises in fundamental issues. About the school issue he spoke at considerable length: That is indeed the fundamental issue of all. Minister-President Hoffmann was just a teacher and thus in his field of expertise. Very difficult to negotiate with this Government, because it knows nothing of reason and justice, but only its Party program.

<p>The school issue: Labor strikes are a two-edged sword. They are our last resort, if Hoffmann tries to force the children into the joint-secular-school or if Protestants are going to have supervisory power over Catholic religious instruction. But I don’t want to bless it. Is the situation still peaceful, and are people thinking of the monarchy? – It is impossible now to return to it.

<p>“How are the clergy?” Good, a third in the city of Munich and many new catechisms needed. “The filling of open pastor positions has now been provisionally agreed?” – Yes. “The death of Cardinal Hartmann was so sad for me, because I became Cardinal in the same Consistory, and especially on that account, because now there must be negotiation with the Government about Cologne.” “In Bavaria there is a different mode of appointment than in Prussia.” Yes, but the new Government cannot appoint the Bishop. No, no, but a way will be found: Many questions, whether agreement exists about a person..

<p>The Nunciature in Munich: Pacelli is doing what he can. But it is difficult to negotiate with Hoffmann, because he is not familiar with the subject matter and must take account of his party. It is essential to preserve the Nunciature in Munich, because the political situation and especially unity is not stable and because he has a totally different level of respect among a Catholic people. If history would only go backwards. He agreed strongly with that. “We are doing what we can to preserve the Nunciature.”

<p>Concordat: There was an agreement and if in several points it has been violated, then it exists no more. But be ready, most promptly, to make a new agreement. Response: That is essential, because the Reich Constitution can one day be broken up, and because the freedom guaranteed in the Reich Constitution must be carried on. Kept saying again, we want to make an agreement.

<p>Anima: It is an ecclesiastical, not political institution, thus no new political order here! Germans from the Reich should participate (“a greater participation” as previously). It is very important for us that we be able to send seminarians here. Oh, yes, yes.
Standing up: I should very soon make the donations for Prelates and honoraria so that I can bring along the Brevi. (But the secretaries have so much to do now). “Oh no, it will be done immediately.” I ask for his blessing and permission to impart the blessing publicly. 

<p>He did not allow me to kneel, and he is very short. Very animated when speaking.</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Extremely warm and charitable, did not allow his ring to be kissed, ...

<p>How good it is that in the Codex there is nothing about “State and Church.” “We are very thankful for the observations of the Bishops. Do you want to see?” He holds up the first exemplar with inserted comments. How valuable the [canon] law book is.

<p>Bavaria: So long as you had a crazy king, you were for the monarchy, and now, when you had a sound and intellectually very capable king, you want a republic.

<p>Saar Diocese: Obviously he says: No, no...

<p>Nunciature: Political unity is a utopia. Bavaria and Prussia have such different character that such unitary undertaking is impossible over the long run. The Socialists want it for political reasons, the Reich Government for fear that Bavaria could seek to ally with France (“The French naturally want a splitting up”), and for later time it would be good if nothing would be changed.  He thought that the Reich would rather want to have an Embassy. My response: Yes, but then first of all assurance that the Nunciature will be preserved in Munich as well, otherwise it will soon be said: Why then two?

<p>Extradition of the Kaiser: About that he spoke at considerable length and confidentially. First an article in L’Osservatore Romano, then right away to Wilson with this article, then to Italy. As to the Kaiser, entirely certain, Holland will not extradite him. As to other officers the text is different. He quoted in French [from the Versailles Treaty]: Here “Germany acknowledges the right,” but a right does not have to be used, Japan, Italy ... do not desire it, thus only England and France still remain, and they will also recognize it would be absurd, absolutely absurd. Thus he spoke at length.  If the Kaiser is not extradicted, he has the Catholic Church to thank.

<p>[Bavarian Ambassador to the Vatican] Ritter is coming back tomorrow, he wrote.

<p>Our Government is a government by political parties. Since they are not about reason and justice, “we Bishops must speak a sharp word once in a while.” The Catholic people desire that (he smiles understandingly). 
<p>Pacelli has traveled to Berlin and Cologne. Bishp Schulte is to be transferred to Cologne. The Government will certainly allow it, because no other person has come into the question.

<p><strong>Late 1919 to early 1920</strong> <em>The German Spirit and Jew-Hatred</em>, published by the People Power League (1920); excerpts:

<a name="40"></a><p><strong>Statement of Matthias Erzberger,</strong> former German Finance Minister (June 21, 1919 to March 12, 1920) (pp. 35-36):
    
<p>I condemn the antisemitic incitement that is currently being organized and promoted by certain elements in Germany.  My view of the civil equality in rights and duties for all German citizens leads me to deplore unscrupulous antisemitic activity in the strongest manner.  My view is supported by the German constitution.  Article 109, section 1 provides that all Germans are equal before the law.  Article 135 grants all residents of the German Reich the enjoyment of freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.  Article 135 provides that the rights and duties of citizens at the federal and state level may not be abridged or conditioned.  The background of antisemitic incitement is well enough known.  The circle from which it emanates is supported by elements that have a self-interest in seeking a diversion from their guilt for their rash chauvinism.
   
<p>Moreover, there are indications close at hand that alongside incitement against Jews there is a parallel incitement against Socialists and Catholics, or better said, there is a system at work, first on the Jews, then the Socialists, then the Catholics.  I readily admit the notable fact that a certain prejudice against the Jews is understandable as a result of the preponderant role of Jewish elements in the Independent Social Democratic Party leadership, but in the final analysis this fact is also understandable.  For it is clear that those elements that formerly were effectively shut out from power are now seeking to make up for it.
    
<p>The position I take as to antisemitic incitement is all the more plain since I have consistently stood up for the equal rights of our Jewish fellow citizens.  I am reminded that, among other things, I regularly fought against holding Jews back in the army, particularly in the officer corps.  Respectable demeanor and ability are the only criteria for every German.  Equality of rights in civic activity and religious exercise belongs to the fundamental rights of every German.  My view is that of the entire Reich Government.  The Government is resolved to oppose antisemitic incitement with the full power of the law.
  
<p>In a democratic country, pogroms have no place.  We have no need to resemble Russia.
   
<p>I myself – and I do not think it amiss if I say the Government as well – am sympathetic toward the efforts being pursued by the Zionists in Palestine.   In that regard, I refer to the declaration issued by the former Undersecretary of the Foreign Office, Baron von dem Busche-Haddenhausen.  As for the prospects of the Jewish people in this respect, so far as I am informed, the English Government stands well-disposed on this question.  Should the Jewish State in Palestine become a reality, I hold out the firm hope that the Christian places on holy ground within that State will have all desirable freedoms.

<a name="41"></a><p><strong>Statement of Antonius von Henle,</strong> Bishop of Regensburg [northeastern Bavaria] (p.56):
    
<blockquote>I repudiate Jew-hatred with every fiber of my being, because every hatred is un-Christian, but we must be careful with this reproach.  In most cases anti-Jewish agitations are directed not against a race or a religion, but rather against the dregs thereof.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Statement of Dr. Baron von Ow,</strong> Bishop of Passau [eastern Bavaria] (p.94):
    
<blockquote>Your invitation to send in my judgment about the Jewish question, I will not leave unanswered, even though I do not think that what I have to say will serve your purposes.
    
<p>Right in the first sentence of your highly esteemed request is something I cannot agree with.  “Jew-hatred,” aside perhaps from some isolated instances that are diminishing and therefore meaningless, is not being incited in Germany.   What passes today for so-called “Jew-hatred” in written or verbal remarks that are more or less overly high-spirited, is nothing other than the natural reaction against the vile, heartless, capitalistic spirit of usury and against the absurd destruction of all the achievements of our culture by a senseless Bolshevism:  the representatives and promoters of these two movements are today, moreover, chiefly members of the Jewish race, and one of the leading mindsets within Jewry – a mindset that is found so predominantly only within this circle – is the primary handmaid and propagator of all those unholy phenomena that poison our entire economic life by driving out ethical values in favor of the crassest egoism and materialism.
   
<p>It is only against this aspect of Jewry that defensive measures are raised, which may sometimes in part be advanced in a sharp manner, but still are far removed from inciting “Jew-hatred,” much less a persecution of Jews on account of their religion or their nationality.  Even if in one case or another, measures have exceeded the bounds of justified defense, there is in such cases not nearly so critical a danger to the “reputation of German culture” as there is from the phenomena against which those defenses are raised.</blockquote>
<p>Note:  One historian who mentions <em>The German Spirit and Jew-Hatred</em>, only with respect to the Bishop of Passau’s contribution, is Rudolf Lill in “German Catholicism’s Attitude towards the Jews in the Weimar Republic,” in Otto Dov Kulka and Paul Mendes-Flohr, <em>Judaism and Christianity under the Impact of National Socialism</em> (1987), p.159.  Lill attributes the Bishop’s statement to his strong attachment to the Bavarian monarchy, which was overthrown by a revolution which numbered Jews among its leaders.

<a name="42"></a><p><strong>Foreword of the People Power League:</strong>  

<blockquote>The moral principles of the People Power League – which does not serve any political faction, but rather desires to work in the purely cultural field – obligate its members to stand up for the noblest strengths of our people, for that form of humanity which allows itself to be led by the holy spirit of understanding, for the reconciliation of all who wear the face of humanity.
   
<p>To that category belong Jews as well as racial Germans.  Those Jews who live by right in Germany, often rooted here even centuries-long, cannot be treated with hostility by our people.  Those of us who are German-born are all called to cooperate likemindedly toward the dedication of the Fatherland to true culture.  Violation of rights, terrorizing of Jews, would be civil war in our country and the discrediting of our new free state.  It would be reactionary, and a foolish anachronism in the era of the League of Nations.  In the face of all that is unsettling, the People Power League would like to help preserve our Fatherland, not as shock troops for some sort of party faction, but rather as the protector of a German character that does not depart from the ideals of our humanists, our great thinkers and poets going back to Lessing, Herder, Goethe and Schiller.
   
<p>Our League is no less enthusiastic for every virtue of the German race than the antisemites are raving for them.  It is only that we are committed to proceed truly and critically, exactly toward the Jews as toward all other races.  The People Power League is strictly neutral toward all political and religious inclinations, all classes and races.  It is nationalist and at the same time internationalist, in that it strives in the best German way toward the best in humanity. 
   
<p>Thus we have considered it our duty, in this time of intolerance and terrorism against our Jewish fellow <em>Volk</em> members, to approach several hundred outstanding non-Jewish Germans with the request that they frankly express themselves on the Jewish question.
   
<p>This is a matter of assembling contributions to a non-partisan judgment of the Jewish question and bringing the collected documents to the attention of the German people and other peoples ...
   
<p>This collection contains pro-Jewish and anti-Jewish responses to the inquiry we arranged.  More than a hundred requests went unanswered.  Many statements were given with careful reserve.  But despite all that, so many prominent personalities from all spheres of present-day Germany have unambiguously rendered their judgment on Jew-hatred, that we could justifiably give this collection the title: “The German Spirit and Jew-Hatred.”
   
<p>May it contribute to expanding the spirit of understanding and reconciliation among our people.  Without that spirit our people cannot be strengthened either economically or politically or culturally.

<blockquote>With lively interest I have taken notice of the efforts of the People Power League for the preservation of the solidarity and peacefulness of the German people and the furthering of understanding among the religious denominations.  The fundamental democratic and social concepts on which our new form of State is built inherently exclude every form of differential treatment based on denomination, and in particular based on antisemitism; but I am also convinced that the healthy and fair spirit of our people condemns the disparagement of Jewry that is salient only idiosyncratically, and decisively rejects every slight toward Jewish fellow citizens, every antisemitic incitement and every attempt at arousing Jew-hatred.  From my heart I wish your efforts complete success by way of enlightening our people to contribute to, and thereby cooperate in, the preservation of that domestic peace which is so indispensable for the future of our work.

<p>(Ed.: <em>One of the most significant manifestos emanating in recent times from German Catholic circles is undoubtedly the great keynote address delivered by the archbishop of Munich, Mgr Faulhaber, to the great Catholic Congress held in that city at the end of October 1919.  These declarations have produced a great impression everywhere.

<p>It can be said that, in the person of the archbishop, it is the German bishops as a whole who are taking a position in the face of the new order of things, political and social, created in Germany by the Revolution.  Our readers will find here, along with a doctrinal exposition of the civilizing role of the Church, some rather unexpected averments coming from German lips.  We believe it our duty to translate </em>in extensor<em>, in accord with Catholic newspapers beyond the Rhine, this speech, which constitutes a document of premier merit and of striking timeliness:</em>)

<p>[Note: Some portions of the following speech are enclosed in brackets, to indicate portions that were not in the <a href="#32">original version of the speech</a> but rather were added later, as it was <a href="itimeline.html#19191026a">sent to the Vatican</a> and eventually to <em>Documentation Catholique</em>.] 

<p><strong>The Church can intervene in public life</strong>

<p>The new generation displays the pretention of excluding from public life the influence of religion and the Church.  We would like to show, to the contrary, that religion and the Church have the right to intervene in public life; that they are the indispensable auxiliaries of the State, that they constitute an inestimable source of good for social life.

<p><strong>Our Lord himself gave the order for this</strong>

<p>When Christ confided to his apostles the mission <em>“to go into all the world and teach all the nations,”</em> he insisted on the universality of this mission: “into <em>all</em> the world,” “<em>all</em> the nations.”  There is no salvation in any other name than his.

<p>Likewise, in the order of public life itself, it is again the religion of the cross that must be the salvation of the world and that must renew the face of the earth.  For political entities as well, the law of Christ must be the yeast that penetrates the entire mass.  The Savior had already said to the 
apostles: <em>What I confide to your ear, preach it from the rooftops</em>, that is in the public squares of the towns and villages.  And the day when Peter, who had on earth the keys to the kingdom of heaven, shook from his feet the dust of the land of Judea, he turned his gaze toward Rome, the great crossroads of the peoples.  It is not in the valleys of the Himalayas that he set up his seat, nor in the solitude of the African deserts, but in Rome, the capital of knowledge, the home of world history.  Christ built his church at the crossroads of the great paths of history.

<p>[<strong>Religion is not just a personal affair</strong>]

<p>Religion and the Church have the right to speak their message in public life.  

<p>From Erfurt has just arrived an entirely new watchword for us:  Let’s make religion a private affair.  A private affair, what does that mean?  If one means by that, that everyone can take from religion what he wants and make himself a catechism to his liking, or else that religion has nothing to do with the affairs of the community, or finally that we must stand by silent and unmoved at the ruin of our Church, in such case the formula is false.
<p>But if one means that religion is first of all a personal affair, the formula becomes acceptable, because it is necessary first that the interior personal life be impregnated and lifted up by the thought of the kingdom of God; the individual must be animated first and foremost by the spirit of prayer and the spirit of faith, by the love of God and love for neighbor, before going to preach this spirit at high noon in public life.

<p>[<strong>Objection: “Clauso ostio, ora Patrem”</strong>]

<p>Christ indeed said to the Pharisees: <em>If you want to pray, go into a secret place.</em> But he was addressing himself to the Pharisees, who were making the street into their place of prayer, displaying their piety like a placard, and neglecting moreover to keep the Kingdom of God within themselves.  Jesus meant to say to them: “Your religion must not be only an exterior religion, go back first into the sanctuary of your heart.”

<p>To the apostles, by contrast, Christ declared: <em>Whoever denies me before men, I will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.  And whoever acknowledges me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven.</em>

<p>Man is constituted of only one and the same personality and not the aggregation of two pieces of personality: the one for private and personal life, the other for public life.  One would thus not be able to be Christian on the inside and pagan on the outside.  It is an illusion of being intimate at home for Christ and with Christ, and to want in public, as an official or representative, <em>to be against Christ and dissipate</em> his work.  One can certainly wear one set of clothes at home and change when one goes out; but we cannot change like clothing the soul that holds the fiber of our being.

<p>How to judge this case of conscience of an individual who is bound, on the one hand, to acknowledge God as sovereign Master and Creator, [and who is placed on notice, on the other hand, by the civil power, to deny officially this faith?]  Isn’t it necessary that what is a duty for conscience and the soul be reflected also in public life?

<p>[<strong>Anti-clericalism leads the Church to deal with politics</strong>]

<p>From the fact that Socialism establishes as a doctrine that religion is a private affair, it should logically follow that [anti-clericalism] be proclaimed also a private affair.  If, then, the secular spirit pervades politics, inserts itself into the legislative machinery and begins to forge the laws, then religion is, by that fact, entitled to take an interest in politics.

<p>We are reproached for leaving the field of religion and invading that of politics; yet every day excursions are made from the domain of the State into that of the Church.

<p>The question of the reciprocal relationships between Socialism and the Church figures prominently in discussions in the public square; and religion is supposed to shut itself up, like any private affair, within the four walls of a house!

<p>Ah! Today we really see why it is always, in the final analysis, against the Catholic Church that one wants to make war.  All the partial assaults that are directed here or there are nothing other than local skirmishes of a gigantic duel that began in the first days between the good and evil spirits; the course of centuries has only served to make more clear the division between the two camps of this universal battle.  Now, from this side here, it is the Church of Christ that has the mission to keep up the good fight for the verities of Christ.

<p><strong>The Church and religion are a necessity for the State</strong>

<p>Religion and the Church thus have their message to speak in public life.

<p>I say now: religion and the Church are a necessary factor for public life.

<p>Here, I make reference to the phrase of ancient Plato: “Destroy religion, that will upset the very foundations of the social order.”

<p><strong>A point of authority from outside the 4th Commandment, outside religion</strong>

<p>One may profit by giving a little quiz on this issue to every Minister of Education and Culture.  Does the State have need of authority?  Undoubtedly.  And what is the precondition of authority?  Authority supposes that the population has confidence in those who want to govern the people.  Now, for us, Catholics, all authority rests on the fourth commandment of God; in its turn, human authority that recognizes the fourth commandment is based on the authority of God, proclaimed by the first three commandments.

<p>If, then, a government  has faith in the first three commandments, it establishes for itself the foundations of its authority, and the people, with their instinctive logic, have a right to say to them:  “If you no longer believe in the authority of God, then we no longer believe in your authority.”  Whoever wants to maintain his authority must recognize the fourth commandment and thereby religion itself.  Whoever destroys religion destroys the foundations of social life.

<p><strong>Solid dogmas make nations strong</strong>

<p>It is a necessity for the State to have at its base certain indestructible principles.  It is only sound dogmas that make the peoples strong.

<p>These sound principles, we find them, we Catholics, in our Catholic dogmas, made fruitful by the blood of the martyrs from the time of the catacombs and consecrated by the faith of centuries.  Now, these principles of the Church illumine and strengthen loyalty and confidence in human relations.  Wherever faith in God is weakened, it is inevitable that loyalty among men will disappear.

<p>Sound principles, we have them in the magisterial work that became definitively applicable on the day of Pentecost 1918, I mean the Code of Canon Law, which is like the constitutional act of the Catholic Church.  In it we find the Spirit of God that hovered over the chaos.  In it we see clearly defined the ideal to aspire to and the most direct way to achieve it.  There, no compromise, no hesitation; one is certain of finding the direction that does not lead astray and one voluntarily gives one’s hand to the guide who leads you.

<p><strong>The Decalogue is: First, the imperious expression of the natural law</strong>

<p>Sound fundamental laws!  The law, it is a principle in action that takes me by the hand with a command: “You shall,” and it intends to lead me on that specified path.  What are these fundamental laws?  “Honor your father and your mother, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not lie.”  The Decalogue has given us these fundamental laws of a public life truly worthy of men.

<p>One notes, undoubtedly, that these obligations are already dictated by the natural law.  But history testifies that the prescriptions of natural law permit the establishment of a political edifice that is durable and worthy of humanity only when the citizens feel bound to these laws by a religious obligation.

<p>Some presume perhaps to be able to come individually to religion; but they do not take into account that they live on soil where Christianity has incorporated these laws into the moral heritage of our era and our people.

<p><strong>Second, the surest support for civil law</strong>

<p>How could the State, when it published laws and ordinances, make its citizens obliged by conscience to obey them?  Will it be, perhaps, by great multiplication of police or simply all at once by articles of law?  A State authority that is only based on police and grenades is very shaky.  

<p>It is to the conscience that the appeal must be made; the citizen should consider himself bound in the interior forum to carry out his duty toward the State; so, there is only the voice of God now for commanding the conscience; in other words, the voice and the prescriptions of religion.

<p><strong>Religion guarantees morality: First, in commercial transactions</strong>

<p>Those who promote the formula, “Religion, individual affair,” also neglect another point of view.  The excesses of capitalism will only be ended by furthering the education of the public conscience and the formation of citizens who embrace a moral obligation to renounce the disordered appetite of lucre and the execrable cult of Mammon, the idol of our era.

<p><strong>Second, the oath in political matters</strong>

<p>Here, it is right for me to cite to these utopians another concrete example of the social importance of religion.  One recalls the historic hour when, at Weimar, the debate over the Constitution came to an end upon the last reading.  Our governors were there around this fundamental act and they said to each other: “The Constitution, here it is, but how to oblige citizens to observe it?  Naturally, we will act as in the good old days, we will have recourse to the formula of an oath: <em>I swear!</em>  Very well, but still, to take an oath, that is to take the name of God as witness.  Now, at the same time, we never want this name to be officially mentioned.  Thus we arrive at this solution: We share this oath as a religious oath for those who believe in God, and as a civil oath for those who do not believe in him.”

<p>But an oath is an oath, and it cannot be torn apart in that way.  To take an oath is to speak in full clarity and truth; it is to desire, in a serious question, to exclude all ambiguity of formula and thought.  Either the oath is the invocation of God on the lips of a believer, or there is no longer any oath.  That is what cannot be forgotten.

<p>If then, from one side, one glories in signaling to God his dismissal from public life, one is not in a good position to call upon him again when one can no longer do without his support.

<p>We must take care that the oath, a holy thing, not be emptied of its true meaning by this secularized concept; we must keep it from being reduced to nothing more than a simple instrument of police.

<p><strong>Third, the oath in fiscal matters</strong>

<p>While, after many hesitations, the new German Empire has decided to set its finances in order, it has not found any surer method than to have attestations made for each amount owed, under the faith of the oath, the importance of its fiscal obligation.  There we see, Gentlemen, a case where the new State can recall one more time that there is a God whose sacred name is useful even for making payment of taxes.

<p>Ah, if one had a good police dog capable of sniffing out hidden fortunes, one would be protected from having recourse to the oath.  But, failing any other expedient, it was necessary to resort to this procedure.

<p>Thus believers, bound by the oath, which is the sincere expression of their belief in God, are bound to pay into the tax authority their last penny under pain of perjury.  The free-thinkers do not run such a danger.

<p>Thus, contrary to democratic principle, citizens have been divided into two classes.  Now, a fiscal edict should apply to all, an exceptional law cannot be created for one category of individuals.  Also, all believers should have the right to say: “I refuse to take the fiscal oath.  If you, the new State, mean to avoid God for everyone else, if you do not want to acknowledge the sixth commandment and the other ones, if you allow blasphemy against God to be displayed right on the street, you are ill qualified to invoke the second commandment of God because you think it necessary for the functioning of your tax laws.”

<p>It remains that whoever destroys religion destroys thereby the very foundations of the social order.

<p><strong>The Church and religion: source of inestimable benefits for social life</strong>

<p>We arrive at our third affirmation: religion and the Church are a source of inestimable benefits for public life.

<p>I will point out just a few of them.

<p><strong>Religion, by belief in the transcendent, restrains earthly covetousness</strong>

<p>And first of all, they preach faith in the transcendent.  Our society, permeated by the spirit of the age, is absorbed in the search and pursuit for earthly goods and pleasures; while people are dying of starvation, others are gorging on well-being; we are steadily sinking into the swamp of Sodom and Gomorrah.

<p>It is really time, Gentlemen, for religion to promulgate its code of well-being: “You were born for higher purposes.”  “I desire that there be enmity between those who spend their life reveling in this miserable dust and those who raise their sights toward the Immaculate Virgin.  I desire that the spirit reign over the flesh, that the eternal bring it upon what is happening; I desire that the divine law and the supernatural bring it upon the material.”

<p>There is the immense renewal that the Church and religion preach.  The grace of God places the strength of the Church at your service; sustained by her, enlightened by faith in the transcendent, you will find the solution to so many problems and you will be able to raise up your family, your work, all of public life.

<p><strong>Religion alone can provide the solution to social problems</strong>

<p>Allow me to recount the immortal Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII.  One reads them like a communiqué for our time, like a prophetic appeal on the eve of a worldwide catastrophe.  The Social Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII have already studied all problems and have indicated the solution.

<p><strong>Religion condemns egoism</strong>

<p>It is in proclaiming for individuals the unlimited freedom to work to fill their pocketbooks, recognizing in particular the right to all pleasures without restriction, that social liberalism has plunged us into the chaos with which we are struggling.  Only Leo XIII, in his Encyclicals, has formulated a solution to the social question: “The worker must not be considered like merchandise.”

<p><strong>Religion ennobles work</strong>

<p>If we want ardor for work to be reawakened among us, let us not forget that in the final analysis it is only faith that can excite such ardor and inspire concern for the common good.  To the eyes of faith, indeed, work takes on a higher meaning; it is the seed of eternity and makes the worker the servant of God.  Sunday in the life of the worker, this social law, this divine precept, which introduces a bit of calm in the agitation of existence, which projects a trait of radiant light among the worries of daily labor, the hour spent in the mission of God, transfigured by the splendors of the Eucharistic liturgy and Christian art: these are the particularly active elements for stimulating ardor in work and thus promoting the solution to the grave problem of the present hour.

<p><strong>Religion places love of truth at the foundation of social relationships</strong>

<p>Another blessing brought by religion and the Church into public life is the love of truth.  Let me express a thought that has been with me for a long time.  When indeed are we going to have in our legal codes a law that cracks down on organized lying, just as there is a law that punishes those who poison public fountains?  When are we going to have a law that protects the truth?  This law is what we will have when the State starts to keep watch over the observation of the eighth commandment: “You shall not lie,” with the same care that it watches over the observation of the seventh: “You shall not steal.”  We ourselves, we impose upon ourselves the respect for the truth as a primordial law.

<p>We others, Germans, we have to disengage ourselves from this presumption of considering ourselves as a particularly chosen people, called to take a totally privileged place in the world.

<p>In honor of the truth, we will hold ourselves modestly in the place that is ours, and we will work that corner of the earth that has fallen to us today.  This law of truth will open our eyes to many errors that are being committed.

<p>The economic struggle separates and divides like everything that is worldly.  Religion unites, because it signifies the uniting of the soul with God.  Religion gathers, in one shared faith and in one house of God, those that discord has separated.  What a treasure for promoting social peace and for developing the sense of solidarity!

<p><strong>Religion introduces the soul of charity into the political mechanism</strong>

<p>And, finally, the benefit of love.  To be sure, we cannot complain of being malprovisioned in articles of law.  To judge from the placards, decrees and legal provisions that were seen the day after the Revolution, one could hardly dare to maintain that we are freed from German bureaucracy and the passion for passing laws.  Religion alone can extirpate to root the abuses from which we suffer; charity alone can give to the mass of the people soul, warmth and life.  The governmental organism rests upon a machine of cold steel, brutal, insensible as steel, if charity, love of neighbor, does not come to animate this organism and give it life.

<p>Saint Boniface did more for the German State than Chancellor Bismarck; Bismarck’s iron machine is in shards, while the spirit of Saint Boniface remains with us, and he will help us rebuild our house from these ruins.  

<p>Therefore give place to Christian charity in all its forms!  It will make the beneficent influence of religion and the Church radiate into public life.  This free daughter of heaven that is charity does not know the bonds of constraint; she is only able to accomplish her work if she if allowed to be liberally deployed.

<p>Here, in Munich, one has dared to declare publicly:  “Since the cathedrals of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church has never produced anything great.”  The author of this phrase has certainly not read the Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII and has still not opened the new Code of Canon Law.  He does not know that the houses of Don Bosco pour into social life each year 2,500 young people who sometimes are led there by force, and in every case, have received there the blessing of instruction and education.  This marvel of charity, is it not still like a basilica whose steeple extends proudly toward the heavens?  In the Middle Ages, the popes crowned the emperors; in our day, they have given us, in the Encyclicals, social ideas that have an import that is fruitful in a different way.  In this moment still, it is the Code of Canon Law that rises up before us, such a splendid cathedral of the spirit, worthy of figuring alongside the cathedrals of centuries gone by.

<p>[Catholics,] from this arena of the Circus Krone where you are assembled, carry out faith in the invincible cross and love of Holy Church, right into public life, just as long ago the Christians [of the Catacombs] did.  Do not allow the sanctuary to be touched, do not allow the sacred rights of your Church to be trampled underfoot; be on your guard, [be on your guard,] and keep each other on alert!</blockquote><br>

<a name="43d"></a><p><strong>Jan. 4, 1920</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri:

<blockquote>Returning last night from my trip to Berlin and Cologne, carried out per instructions of Your Most Reverend Eminence, I have the honor to report without delay about the outcome of the same.

<p>In order to have upon my arrival in Berlin a prompt response to the questions that Your Eminence instructed me to handle with the Reich Government and that of Prussia, I deemed it opportune to make them known in advance by two letters sent by me to the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires, Count von Zech, respectively dated the 19th and 24th of December last year and for which I carry out my duty to send copies here enclosed (Attachments I and II). In this way the competent Authorities (who, especially here in Germany, before making a decision on an important matter, are always in the habit of requesting legal opinions, holding meetings, etc.) would have a way to examine it beforehand and I would not expose myself to the danger of spending considerable time uselessly in Berlin.
<p>I further believe it my duty to add that in the two days of my stay in Berlin, the Government kept giving me much special attention. The evening of December 29, the <em>Reich</em> President, Mr. Ebert, held a dinner in my honor, attended by the Chancellor, various Ministers, Undersecretaries and officials of the State. Mr. Ebert (who was born a Catholic) welcomed me with the greatest cordiality. He told me that domestic conditions in Germany will tend to improve, albeit rather slowly, but that demands by the Entente could at any moment cast the Country into anarchy once again. In this regard the issue that most preoccupies the Government at this moment – apart from the threatened suppression of the civic guard or Einwohnerwehr, which has succeeded up to now in holding the Communists at bay – is the so-called <em>Auslieferungsfrage</em> [extradition issue], that is the extradition of persons demanded by the Entente. In Mr. Ebert’s judgment, it could cause a military revolt, which would provoke a reaction by the extreme leftwing parties with incalculable consequences; the Government would no longer be able to sustain itself and the Nation would fall into chaos. Germany has declared itself ready to have those guilty judged by German tribunals, where representatives of the Entente would also be allowed to take part in the proceeding, and it [the Government] is disposed in this regard to all possible concessions. When I reminded him that the Holy See had taken this question quite to heart, as demonstrated moreover in the magnificent articles appearing several months ago in <em>Unità Cattolica</em>, Mr. President charged me to ask the same Holy See to consider again an effort to forestall such a great danger. Mr. Ebert then spoke to me also about the proposed erection of a <em>Reich</em> Embassy at the Holy See. He confirmed to me that the Government already had such intentions, but that the proposal had remained suspended because, Bavaria wanting to maintain its Legation, Prussia also claimed an equal right, and it would have been impossible to have three representatives from Germany in Rome, being the <em>Reich</em> Ambassador, the Prussian Minister and the Bavarian Minister. Now, however, an agreement has been reached upon the following basis, already accepted by Mr. Hoffmann, in agreement with the heads of the various parties in Bavaria: The above-mentioned Embassy, to whose expenses Bavaria will not itself contribute, will be directly and immediately at the disposal of the Bavarian Government for handling its interests and for negotiations with the Holy See. To this end, it will receive its instructions directly from the Bavarian Government and will be bound to carry them out, with the Berlin Foreign Ministry excluded from any sort of intervention, and it will also send the related reports directly. Furthermore, the same Minister will give orders to the Embassy to transmit to the Bavarian Government copies of those reports sent to Berlin that concern the general situation or matters that have additional importance for Bavaria, as also to send the aforesaid Government reports, even when not requested, having any issue that may concern Bavarian interests. For Baron von Ritter, who would thus cease his functions as Minister to the Holy See, a convenient settlement would be made. 

<p>President Ebert also mentioned the Government’s desire for the correlative institution of an Apostolic Nunciature in Berlin; but I, not knowing in any way the intentions of the Holy See in this regard, abstained from any sort of statement in this matter. I recommended to him instead, by charge of the aforesaid Eminence Bertram, that Germany also make energetic steps for the restitution of the property of the Diocese of Breslau that has been occupied by Czecho-Slovakia. 

<p>The following day, December 30, I was offered a luncheon by the Imperial Chancellor, to which were equally invited various political personages, and that evening I left for Cologne, where I arrived the following morning towards 9:30.

<p>I celebrated Holy Mass in the Chapel of the Seminary, where I was staying, then went at 11:30 to the Cathedral, where I was solemnly received by the entire Metropolitan Chapter, and after having prayed in front of the Blessed Sacrament Altar, I was taken, always accompanied by the Most Reverend Canons, into the Chapter Hall. The Responsible, Monsignor Middendorf, commenced with suitable words of greeting and obsequy toward the Representative of the Holy Father, and then I gave a speech in German, which I hereby enclose in Italian translation (Attachment IV). In it, after giving the obligatory tribute of homage to the memory of the deceased Most Eminent Cardinal von Hartmann and describing the current state of relations between Church and State in Germany, I explained to the Chapter how, it being necessary to provide solicitously and in the best possible way for this most important Archepiscopal Church, the Holy See had permitted that the election by the Chapter would take place this time under the norms of the Bull <em>De Salute Animarum</em> and the Letter <em>Quod de Fidelium</em>, but with the express proviso, already accepted by the Government of Berlin, that this cannot constitute a precedent for the definitive resolution of the question, adding that the Holy See reserves to itself to subject to benevolent examination the privilege of election exercised up to now by the same Chapter. I indicated finally that the Holy Father would be prove most appreciative if the votes of the Chapter members were cast for the Bishop of Paderborn, a Prelate also most acceptable to the Government, and whose praises I sang. It seemed to me opportune and respectful to express in the mild form of a <em>desire</em> of the August Pontiff the order contained in the venerated cable no. 209, that is to say, the Chapter “this time shall postulate (or elect) the Bishop of Paderborn.” Despite that, this communication aroused a lively discussion, during which, as the result of questions repeatedly directed to me, I viewed myself as required to make it delicately understood that the aforesaid desire had in itself the force of a command. The Canons raised difficulties not only as to principle, in that their election, if restricted to a single name, would not be fully free, but also, and primarily, as to and against the person of Monsignor Schulte, as a persona non grata. To the objections of principle, I resonded that the adopted provision had been provoked by the current extraordinary circumstances which were amply described by me; that the Holy See, in permitting the election, had already given proof of its benevolence toward the Chapter, to which, at least for a majority (as the Canons themselves affirmed), the appointment directly by the Holy See itself would be considered even less acceptable; and that finally the Chapter members, freely participating, as devoted sons of the Apostolic See, to an August Desire of His Holiness, having freely elected the one indicated by the Vicar of Jesus Chrsit, could have complete assurance believing this in conscience to be the most worthy act of the office of the Pastors of the illustrious Archdiocese of Cologne.   

<p>As to the person of the Bishop of Paderborn, I asked if there were serious well-founded objections. In reality, however, only two doubts were expressed, 1st, about his health; but I could respond, having learned from Most Eminent Bertram, that the Holy Father had already received information in that regard indicating it was more a matter of somewhat delicate health than of real sickness; 2nd, about his favor with the <em>Volksverein [für das katholische Deutschland]</em>; but I replied that the aforesaid Bishop is of sound doctrine and highly devoted to the Holy See (which all acknowledged), and had thus undoubtedly acted toward this Association, as also toward the interconfessional syndicates, in a manner responsive to pontifical directives and to his dignity as Archbishop. In any event I said to the Canons, to give them the necessary time and calm, that they could have longer to reflect upon the serious issue and that the next day a new audience would be held; a proposal that was accepted with satisfaction. Nonetheless already that evening, the above-mentioned Responsible and the Vicar of the Chapter, Monsignor Vogt, came to me to communicate officially to me in the name of the Chapter that the election of Monsignor Schulte was assured in homage to the pontifical desire (since otherwise he would not have been elected), and that moreover I had been able to convince the electors there were not any serious difficulties against this choice. Mons. Middendorf indicated to me also that ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Re: Secession of the Bavarian People’s Party from the Center Party

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The Bavarian People’s Party (Bayerische Volkspartei) was born with a distinctly separatist inclination. Its founder, Dr. Heim, is a well-known particularist.  He makes no secret of his political views and his program is summarized in these words: “Bavaria for Bavarians!” There was a time - precisely when the revolution broke out in Berlin and it appeared that the central Government would not have the force to put it down - when the Bavarian People’s Party announced the slogan: “Los von Berlin!” [German: free from Berlin!] Moreover, although political adversaries of this party may strive to present it as a simple transformation of the old Center Party camouflaged under a label with a new name, the party has always denied this. And in fact the more influential organs of the Center Party, from the first days of the foundation of the Bayerische Volkspartei, tirelessly urged that it maintain unity with the Center Party and its old program, predicting that sooner or later it would end its separation.

<p>But despite the signs of a future secession,in the near or distant future according to the circumstances, the separatism of the Bavarian People’s Party had to be limited because of supervening issues that were more grave and of vital interest to Bavaria and the Reich, both as to the war demobilization and all the draconian conditions imposed by the enemy, and as to Spartacist movement, which, as is known, was an ephemeral but horrible success right in Bavaria.

<p>In fact during this period of pausing in the particularist tendencies of the Bavarian People’s Party, it was possible in the German National Assembly to secure the passage of laws concerning the cession from the individual federated States to the Reich of the railroads, the post, the finances, the army, the administration of justice and other Public Services, a cession which, for better or worse, the delegates of the said party had to support in Weimar.

<p>Every now and then, however, the separatist tendency of the Bavarian People’s Party popped up in the newspapers that interpreted their thinking, and in assemblies that gathered to discuss various political issues.

<p>But last month when the Prussian Landtag published a proposal signed by the Majority Socialists, the Democrats, and the Center Party, proposing the complete unification of the German State (<em>Einheitsstaat</em>), in other words that all the individual states would lose their political autonomy in favor of the Reich, retaining only administrative autonomy, then the Bavarian People’s Party, alarmed and directly harmed in its most cherished particularist aspirations, began to agitate, protest, threaten, and finally on the morning of January 9th convene a general assembly for the purpose of taking a clear and precise position as to this extremely grave proposal.

<p>It was not difficult to predict what the decision of the meeting would be. In fact, the Assembly enacted Dr. Heim's agenda, rejecting any proposal for the unity of the Reich and declaring that the Bavarian People’s Party is separate from the Center Party.

<p>There were no lack of speakers to speakers present the consequences of this secession, such as the withdrawal of party members from the various Reichstag Commissions, the dismissal of the Treasury Minister, who is a member of the party, the difficulties in working for a solution to important cultural issues, etc. Nonetheless, Dr. Heim maintained his point of view, and the Assembly strongly supported it, assuring however that in matters of a cultural character, the Bavarian People’s Party would naturally proceed in full accord with the Center Party.

<p>What will be the consequences of this schism, beyond those indicated above, is not easy to predict. It cannot really be said that the political horizon in Germany, and particularly in Bavaria, is clear. The men who govern public affairs are not prepared for Government and are scurrying in the dark. The parties are still uncertain about their definitive program. The masses, especially in Munich, are occupied and concerned about bread and coal more than politics, not to mention diversion of all sorts licit and illicit. The leaders of the Bayerische Volkspartei are promising that their secession movement will bring notable advantages for the elections, which are said to be upcoming soon in Bavaria, and they also hope to regain their former absolute majority in the Landtag. It is difficult for now, however, to foresee whether and to what extent these hopes will be realized; in any case, however, it is certain that the policy of the central Government, which is said to be conducted in large part by Minister Erzberger, whose finance program especially meets with the aversion of many, finds no sympathy in Bavaria. Yesterday evening there was a large, tumultuous assembly with the purpose and program of precisely “Los von Berlin!”

<p>Moreover, according to confidential reports now reaching me, even in Berlin the aforementioned project of the unitary State or <em>Einheitsstaat</em> will be abandoned, as it seems, since, at least for now, it is impossible to achieve it.

<p>In the assurance to Your Most Reverend Eminence that I will not fail, as is my duty, to keep You informed about further developments as to these grave issues, I humbly bow to kiss the Sacred Purple ...</blockquote>

<p>“Special Duty of Catholics after the Great War – Substitute Fraternal Charity for Hatred – Apostolic Letter <em>Diuturni</em> addressed by His Holiness Benedict XV to the Bishops of Germany”

<p>Venerable Brothers,

<p>Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

<p>The day has finally come that marks the end, for your nation, of the sufferings of a long and terrible war. The signing of the peace treaty has put an end to the blockade that, particularly in your home, made so many victims among the non-combatants.

<p>We who bear in Our heart the belligerents of both sides, embracing all with a paternal love, We have used all means to extinguish this immense conflagration and to attenuate its consequences. Also, Venerable Brothers, We unite Ourself to you and your fatherland in giving thanks to the Most High for the blessing of peace.

<p>“Put everything into action to assure provisions for Germany”

<p>Your preoccupation must be to raise back up as promptly as possible the ruins accumulated by war. Now, there is no greater help for this work than the action of the Catholic Church, jointly with the help of divine grace; and that is the reason why We decided to address this letter to you.

<p>And first of all, with a view toward sparing Germany the political revolutions that have led your country, and as a result, Europe itself, into catastrophe and that menace, alas!, other nations, it is necessary to put everything into action to assure the provisioning. To this end, Venerable Brothers, by the mediation of the parish priests and other ecclesiastics in closest contact with the population, you shall insistently request the faithful in the countryside to manage alimentary foodstuffs carefully so as to be in a position to provide some to the city dwellers, who are suffering hunger. In such pressing distress, this is an imperative obligation of the law of charity. If this law requires us to love even our enemies, it orders us with even stronger reason to surround with our affection those who are united to us by the bonds of a common fatherland.

<p>Moreover, We firmly hope that all civilized nations, especially the Catholic nations, will hasten to come to the aid of your compatriots, who are reduced, as We know, to extreme destitution; and they will therefore act not only by reason of the perils that menace society, but equally because they are part of the same human family and to conform to the exigencies of Christian charity. All, indeed, should be presented by us with the memory of the word of the apostle St. John: “If anyone has goods of this world and, seeing his brother in need, closes his heart to him, how does the love of God dwell in him?  My little children, do not love in word and language but in action and  truth.”

<p>“Without Christian charity every peace treaty will be a dead letter”

<p>Each of you, Venerable Brothers, must moreover use all the authority of his holy ministry to bind up the moral wounds that the war has caused or aggravated. And it is most especially necessary to forbid all sentiment of hatred, both with regard to foreigners against whom one has fought, and against fellow citizens of various parties. In place of hatred you must substitute fraternal charity, which emanates from Jesus Christ, and which knows no barriers, nor frontiers, nor class struggles.

<p>We express anew the wish, the desire we already manifested during the last Consistory, to see “all men and all peoples united together by Christian charity, without which every peace treaty will be a dead letter.”

<p>We are assured, Venerable Brothers, that as good pastors, ministers of peace and love, you will know how to consecrate all the creativity of your zeal to the accomplishment of this duty and that you will not cease to intercede before the Lord, with your clergy and your flock.

<p>As for Us, Our course will not fail you in the immense distress in which your fatherland moans. It is, indeed, altogether spontaneously that the heart of a father inclines with the greatest tenderness toward those of his children who suffer the most, by the example of the most loving Redeemer of the human race, from whom compassion for the suffering of the multitude evinced this immortal cry: <em>I have pity for the crowd.</em>
<p>As a token of celestial gifts, and as witness of Our particular benevolence, We accord you most affectionately, Venerable Brothers, to you and all those committed to your charge, the Apostolic Benediction.
<p>Given in Rome, near St. Peter’s, July 15, 1919, the fifth year of Our Pontificate.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“Letter of the Cardinal Secretary of State to the National Congress of German-American Catholics”
<p>The Bulletin of the Catholic Federation of the United States (from Quincy, Illinois) of Dec. 1919 brings us the following information and documentd:

<p>The 63rd National Congress of the German Catholic Association (German Catholic <em>Verein</em>) concluded its three days of sessions on Tuesday, September 16, in Chicago.  Obviously significant, since this meeting constituted the first public act since America’s entry into the war at which an appeal could be made to German Catholicism in the United States.

<p>A sensational document was communicated to the Congress, namely a letter from the Sovereign Pontiff; Mgr. Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago, read it to a session on Sunday. On that occasion, His Grace delivered a vigorous speech, but he knew how to show an exquisite sense of discretion and moderation in dealing with certain delicate points. One was little surprised, naturally, to hear the orator celebrating the heroic loyalty of German-Americans toward the star-spangled banner.

<p>This is the letter written by His Eminence Cardinal Gasparri in the name of the Pope:

<blockquote>Secretariat of State of His Holiness, from the Vatican, July 18, 1919,

<p>To Mons. George William Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago.

<p>Most Reverend Archbishop,

<p>The Holy Father has just been informed that, after a long interruption caused by the war, the “Central Verein” (General Association) is going to resume in Chicago the series of its Congresses.

<p>“Past work and loyalty of the German-Americans”

<p>This news brings the greatest pleasure to the Sovereign Pontiff, who is not unaware of the magnificent services rendered by this Association. On the contrary, His Holiness is deeply grieved to learn that you have lost your worthy president, Mr. Frey, for whom he has begged the Lord to receive into his eternal reward.

<p>Today as the “Central Verein” resumes its work,  the Sovereign Pontiff is pleased to address to it the praises that it has well merited by the so brilliant results of its past work; he takes this occasion to send to its associates his paternal greeting, the token of an ever more fruitful future.

<p>The Sovereign Pontiff has full assurance that these lovely hopes will be realized for you, given the remarkable qualities of which the German-Americans have given proof on every occasion and especially during the course of the last war. Always keeping in their hearts a spirited love for the country of their fathers, they have none the less accomplished their full duty with regard to their adopted fatherland:  they have courageously responded to all their appeals, giving without stint for its defense, their gold, their strength and their blood.

<p>“May they now work for the sincere reconciliation of nations”

<p>Now that the war is finally ended, their beneficent zeal can be exercised on a field that is even richer in promise. It is only too true, alas!, that this cruel war, which has so completely divided the human race into two opposing camps, has left behind it a harvest of hatred of peoples toward peoples. And meanwhile, it is impossible for the world to taste at length the blessed fruits of  peace unless the nations lose these hatreds to rebuild with each other the sweet bonds of Christian fraternity.

<p>Catholics must work for this rapprochement in an entirely special way: already united by so intimate a bond in the mystical body of Jesus Christ, they are bound to give continually to others the example of Christian charity. In this sense the German Catholics of the United States, who have such close bonds with each of the two belligerent sides, can play a particularly effective role.
<p>The Holy Father has no more cherished wish than a sincere reconciliation of the nations, and already he has addressed such an appeal to the Bishops of Germany. He turns now to you to ask you to collaborate, you as well, in this sublime crusade of charity.

<p>“May they come quickly to the aid of their brothers of Germany”

<p>Kept up to date about the lamentable situation with which your brothers of Germany are struggling, the Sovereign Pontiff beseeches you insistently to come to their aid by every means of the material and moral order, with all possible speed and effectiveness, notably by facilitating the immediate resumption of commercial relations and all the advantages that are their natural consequence. The Holy Father is convinced that his appeal will be warmly welcomed by you and by all the children of your generous country without distinction: they certainly recall the great services rendered to the United States during the war by their fellow citizens, both those born there and those of the German race; they will therefore make themselves the true benefactors of the human race, and will bring upon their own nation the very special benedictions of God Almighty.

<p>As a token of these benedictions and in the spirit of his paternal affection, the Holy Father accords to Your Grace, to all participants in the congress, and to all your faithful, the Apostolic Benediction.

<p>I am happy to transmit this message to Your Grace with the homage of my most sincere esteem, and I remain Your Grace’s 
Devoted servant,
Pietro Cardinal Gasparri</blockquote>

<p>After having officially accepted the pontifical letter, the Congress adopted various orders of the day. One of them indicated the danger that the Catholic foreign missions of the entire world are encountering because of the clause of the Treaty of Versailles about the withdrawal of German missionaries. A second motion recommends anew the support of the Catholic press. A third calls attention on the fact that a just and lasting peace must have a moral and religious foundation.</blockquote><br>

<p>The Bavarian Government has recognized that the Reich Constitution of August 11, 1919 and the Constitution Declaration of the Free State of Bavaria of August 14, 1919 have transformed the extent and nature of the relations between Church and State, and have changed the legal status of the Catholic Church in Bavaria. The Bavarian Government is gladly prepared to enter into negotiations with the Holy See about new regulation by treaty of the circumstances of the Catholic Church in Bavaria upon the foundation of the Reich Constitution and State Constitution. In this it takes for granted the understanding of the Holy See that in the new agreement not only the governmental-legal, but rather also the financial circumstances of the Catholic Church, will receive their definitive resolution. I would promise a special furtherance of this opportunity, if the Holy See were prepared, before entering into official negotiations, to make known its wishes both in relation to the formal procedure for the negotiations and in relation to substance. I hereby take this occasion with pleasure to give the assurance of my highest esteem, with which I have the honor to be

<p>More unrest was to be feared last week here, so that the City Council had a public warning issued. On Friday I received a warning to go to a safe place. I took action for all events and retired for a few days with some well-wishing people. So it is only now, after returning home, that I am in position to express my delight and congratulations upon Your Excellency’s return from the Eternal City. Frankly, to participate in the misery of our fatherland is a dubious good fortune! Yet: God will provide. I am so attacked that I am capable of almost nothing and often feel life is a burden.

<p>That our public proclamation of right did not take place, seems most correct to me. As I have recently already observed, a protest against the Reich Constitution would have had to be against the outline itself, as a protest against the finished Constitution would have been taken as enmity to the State. But a proclamation in the sense that the state not unilaterally issue orders about Church matters would be pointless, since both the German and Bavarian governments are negotiating about such matters with the Holy See and would quickly just take our memorandum to be on account of the dissolution of state subsidies. 

<p>But in the matter of the priests’ association, I cannot get past the thought that we Bishops are the ones being duped. The Ordinariates indeed have a working relationship with each other in important issues, but such a relationship is not enjoyed among the priest associations, rather they concluded a formal union and now have a single common Bavarian priests association. We can now merely harken that section 2 of this association we be strictly observed and intrusions in purely ecclesiastical matters will be avoided.

<p>Excellency, please forgive these expectorations. But my nerves!

<a name="44c"></a><p><strong>Jan. 24, 1920</strong> Archbishop Faulhaber’s pastoral letter for Lent 1920, translation of the copy sent this date by Nuncio Pacelli in Munich to Cardinal Gasparri in Rome:

<blockquote>Pastoral Letter for the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising, Lent 1920: The Papacy in our Democratic Era

<p>Michael, by God’s mercy and by the grace of the Apostolic Throne, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, confers upon the reverend clergy and all the faithful of the Archdiocese greeting and blessing in the Lord.

<p>Beloved faithful of the Archdiocese! A few days ago I returned from by pilgrimage to Rome, where I reported to the Holy Father about the religious-ecclesiastical condition of the Archdiocese and at the same time, in your name, at the grave of the Prince of the Apostles, prayed the Apostles’ Creed. For five long years it was impossible for the German Bishops to visit and speak with the supreme Teacher and Shepherd of the Church, the Successor to the Apostle Peter. “The roads to Zion mourn” (Lamentations 1:4), at least those roads that led from the central European Church provinces to the Eternal City. And still it must be felt by all Catholics around the world as a robbery of the Church’s freedom, when the undisturbed connection of the Bishops by letter and personal interaction with the Vicar of Christ on Earth can be torn asunder by political world events. That is why it remains indeed one of the most horrible omissions in the peace process, that not once in this peace was the Roman Question addressed, even though it was precisely in this war that the disgraceful and intolerable situation of the Holy Father as Prisoner in the Vatican was revealed in a new glaring light. In Biblical antiquity the soul of the Psalmist rejoiced when the days of pilgrimage to Jerusalem approached: “I rejoiced when they said to me: Let us go up to the House of the Lord. Now our feet are standing in your courts, O City of Peace” (Ps. 121:1ff.).  Thus our soul rejoiced as the isolation of the central point of Christendom finally came to an end and the <em>roads to Rome</em> became free again. 

<p>There in Rome one comes upon the <em>ruins</em> of pagan temples and theaters, upon the broken down pillars of pagan marketplaces and baths, upon the remains of the walls of the Golden House of Nero and of the palaces of the Roman emperors – and the stones of these ruins from pagan antiquity say to us: What God’s hand has destroyed, no human hand shall rebuild again. There in Rome more than 400 churches rise up, overshadowed by the dome of St. Peter’s Church above the grave of the Prince of the Apostles – and the stones of these churches say to us: What God’s hand has built up, no human hand shall destroy. There in Rome one goes on pilgrimage to the <em>Catacombs</em> and to the graves of the blood witnesses of our faith – and the graves of these heroes of the faith say to us: Your faith is anointed with the blood of the martyrs. There in Rome one climbs down into the Mamertine dungeon, where Christian witnesses to the faith celebrated the holy mysteries in the early morning hours and strengthened themselves for the final entrance into the arena of the amphitheater – and the stones of the dungeon and the amphitheater say this to us: Neither trouble nor hardship, neither danger nor persecution, not even the sword, shall separate us from the love of Christ (Romans 8:35). There in Rome one walks the streets on which, from the first century until today, innumerable saints, but also innumerable enemies of the Church, have walked, the streets of the ancient Babylon (I Peter 5:13) and of the new Jerusalem – and the stones of these streets say to us: “The Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the godless leads to the abyss” (Psalm 1:6). We celebrated, at the end of last year in Munich, the three hundredth anniversary memorial of the death of Blessed Lawrence of Brindisi, who lived here in the Capuchin monastery and preached here. 

<p>[With Pope Benedict XV] ... We spoke about the <em>school situation in Bavaria</em>,  where despite the need for bread and coal and clothes and work, people still have time to fight for the influence of the Church in the realms of school and education, and to deliver the souls of young people from malnutrition, and where ever more and more Catholic parents are waking up and standing up in the Catholic parent associations for their inalienable rights over their children. A reverential astonishment gripped me as I saw how well the Holy Father, in these and other issues, knows our situation in Germany and in Bavaria.  

<p>... Monarchical states with their military foundations have collapsed, but the Church, without any military means of power, has survived the upheavals of 1900 years as the <em>Hierarchy of God’s Grace</em>, and will preserve her <em>fundamental monarchical character until the end of time.</em> The Papal tiara will outlast all the kings’ crowns and emperors’ crowns of world history. Voices may well be heard speaking of self-government and the sovereign people, and saying to the Church: “Mother, don’t you want to be more accommodating to the democratic signs of the time and reform your strict hierarchical constitution in a more parliamentary way? Don’t you want to pour new wine into new wineskins and let the people participate in governing?” Then the Church will answer: “Children of the 20th century, you have drunk of the intoxicating wine of the democratic idea, but you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.” <em>The Papal Primacy is an institution of God and is thereby raised up above the developments of contemporary history.</em> 

<p>...

<p>The new Reich constitution has placed the Church founded by Christ on the same level with whatever religious society you like (Article 137, sections 5 and 7) and with it has granted truth and error the same rights. No state constitution, however, can abrogate the words of the Gospel: “Every plant that is not planted by my heavenly Father will be rooted out” (Matthew 15:13). No state constitution can abrogate the words of the Apostle calling the Church of the living God the <em>pillar and foundation of truth</em> (I Timothy 3:15). The wilder the spirits of untruth and mendacity go abroad in public life, the greater the Church appears to us, which guards the holy fire of Pentecost on its altars, and all the greater appears to us the supreme head of the Church, who strengthens the brethren in the faith...

<p>... Whoever persecutes the Church with Saul gets to hear this word with him: “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting” (Acts of the Apostles 9:5).

<p>The Papacy is the rock of secure faith! Have we not experienced with horror in the era of revolution how all order falls apart, all sense of community dies, every depravity comes to power, if there is no strong government in the state?  Let us thank God that we, <em>at least in religious questions, still have an authority that has the last, decisive word</em> on the strength of its supreme teaching office in matters of faith and morals! ... Whoever has eyes to see and ears to hear can observe today in the anti-Church newspapers and assemblies how the systematic campaign of lies against bishops and priests is taking up the old tactic of hell again and giving out the solution: Strike the shepherd, then the flock will scatter itself!

<p>My dear diocesan faithful! Do not let yourselves be ripped away from the community of your Church!  Keep the inner and true connection to your shepherds, to your chief shepherd and to the supreme shepherd in Rome!  <em>Spare the sanctuary of faith the modern catchwords  of self-government and self-salvation!</em> ... Do not tolerate <em>newspapers and pamphlets</em> in your environment that bring incessant calumny against your Church, against Pope and bishops and priests, and sow division in your ranks! ...

<p><em>The Papacy is the rock of moral and social order!</em> ...

<p>... The comforting visits that the Apostolic Nuncio of Munich, Monsignore Pacelli, made to German prisoner of war camps at the charge of the Holy Father, will remain in thankful remembrance among the German people, as will the abundant loving gifts that were distributed among the prisoners by the Apostolic Nunciature in Munich. Since November 1918, since our prisoners of war were unilaterally detained in foreign lands, Pope Benedict has <em>ten times</em> undertaken official steps of solicitude for our prisoners without distinction as to their religion. Also for the war’s other emergencies, especially the food shortage, the Holy Father, although himself poor, was an exceedingly rich helper in time of need.  What our brothers in the faith are sending us today from America, we are receiving by the appeal of the Holy Father, thus indirectly from his hands. Pope Benedict will live on in world history as the Pope of peace and of love. In the era of wrath he has become a reconciliation. Thus, precisely in this time of affliction, it is revealed anew that Christ lives on in his Church, lives on and suffers on, suffers on and continually blesses, continually blesses and continually conquers. “<em>Christ is victor, Christ is king, Christ is ruler!</em>” The German revolution is only superficially a <em>political and economic</em> upheaval; in its foundational impetus it is a <em>moral</em> and <em>religious</em> subversive movement. That will be shown as soon as the deepest roots and ultimate goals of the revolution are uncovered.  In Bavaria up to now the open and even more the slinking form of Kulturkampf has not rested since the outbreak of the revolution. Even Pilate and Herod, those otherwise irreconcilable enemies, struck a bond of brotherhood when it was a matter of opposing the Catholic Church and its servants.  The enemies of the Church are on guard and are forging ever new weapons; so the true children of the Church may not sleep and may not let the weapons of light get rusty.  “See to it that no one leads you astray” (Mark 13:5), and do not let the blows of the Church’s enemies take you by surprise! Be wise and build your house on the rock! The Lord is going to visit his vineyard, which his right hand planted, and may a strong tower remain for the supreme shepherds of the Church against his enemies!

<p>As I departed, the Holy Father gave me authority to  impart to my beloved Archdiocesan faithful the Papal blessing in his name, and thereby to commend all of you to the grace of the Almighty, and especially our dear prisoners of war who are now returning home. The greeting of the Holy Father is the greeting of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles: “Grace be with you and abundant peace” (I Peter 1:2; II Peter 1:2)!  So may the Holy Father’s blessing, like the anointing oil from the head of the high priest (Psalm 132:2) come over you all in the name of the +Father and of the +Son and of the +Holy Sspirit. Amen.

<blockquote>Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Signore,

<p>I have received your encrypted cable no. 341; and in response I will repeat to you what I said yesterday in a strong voice to the Prussian Ambassador.

<p>As you have opportunely stated, the Holy See would prefer:

<p>1st) A German Embassy to the Vatican with a Pontifical Nunciature in Berlin for affairs of Germany except for Bavaria; a Bavarian Legation to the Vatican with a Pontifical Nunciature in Munich for ecclesiastical affairs of Bavaria.

<p>2nd) If the central Government of Germany does not think it can concede this, then the Holy See desires to maintain the <em>status quo ante</em>, that is Legations of Prussia and of Bavaria to the Vatican with a Pontifical Nunciature in Munich.  


<p>The proposal chosen by the Berlin Government (German Embassy to the Vatican with Nunciature in Berlin – suppression of the Bavarian Legation to the Vatican, but the ambassador, for ecclesiastical affairs of Bavaria, would correspond with the Bavarian Government and not with the central Government – Pontifical Nunciature in Munich, if the Holy See so desires) seems to present difficulties that are neither few nor light. In the first place, the Nunciature in Bavaria would have to be in correlation with a Bavarian Ministry in the Vatican. In the second place, it is strange that this German Ambassador would have to carry out part of his mission in accord with Berlin and unbeknownst to Munich, and part in accord with Munich and unbeknownst to Berlin. This split personality could at time become virtually impossible. If, for example, a question were to arise between the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Munich, the same person would have to support the rights of Cologne as the Ambassador of Germany, and the rights of Munich as the Ambassador of Bavaria; a truly curious and embarrassing situation. Finally allow me to add an observation of an exclusively political nature that does not concern the Holy See.

<p>The Berlin Government, with its unitary proposals in general and in particular with the retaining for Bavaria of those prerogatives of former autonomy that are so cherished by Bavaria, obviously favoring the separatist sentiments of Bavaria, actually favored the current policy of France, which completely wants a peace treaty that divides up Germany. The Berlin Government has reflected on this? And has its own need to add this tremendous vital issue to so many others on its table? …

<p>If, notwithstanding these extremely serious considerations, the Berlin Government persists in its unfortunate proposal, the Holy See would undoubtedly desire to keep the Nunciature in Munich, trusting that a brief experience will persuade them to abandon their idea and turn to one of the first two above.

<p>With sentiments of distinct and sincere esteem …</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Zionism: Grave Problems Instigated in Palestine by Jewish Immigration”

<p><em>A well-placed personality for having exact information sends us from Palestine the following article, which is worthy of serious consideration.</em>

<p>I. The Zionist Spirit

<p>The two million Israelites who populated Palestine at the time of the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus in the year 70 (I am giving a probable population figure, but not certain), were dispersed little by little through the Roman world, where they went to join the Jews of the Diaspora.

<p>There was no act of expulsion properly speaking, except as to Jerusalem in the time of Hadrian (the prohibition on entering the Holy City was renewed by Omar). Yet the destruction of the Temple, the prohibition of living in Jerusalem imposed by Hadrian after the revolt of the false messiah Bar-Kochba, and finally the loss of all political influence, led the Jews to disperse in great numbers through the Roman Empire.

<p>They benefited everywhere from a generous toleration, even in the eras when persecution struck the Christians.  Antony allowed them circumcision, which was rigorously prohibited for others.  Caracalla allowed them the right of the Roman city and, despite the rigor of the laws, the practice of polygamy was tolerated among them.  Even more, from the first or second century, and up to the year 429, they had a veritable national sovereign, a descendant of Hillel, who bore the title of ethnarch or patriarch, was surrounded by a sumptuous court, and sent his delegates or <em>apostles</em> through the civilized world to organize communities from the standpoint of exercise of worship and justice.  Indeed of the rights of a sovereign, the only one he lacked was power over life and death, and he even used that one sometimes, with the toleration of the emperors.

<p>Nevertheless, eyes were turning towards Jerusalem.  A first Zionist attempt took place under Julian the Apostate, in the second half of the 4th century.  This emperor-philosophe, in his hatred of Christianity, had wanted to give the lie to Our Lord’s prophecy by restoring the former Temple. “That,” writes an Israelite, Mr. Juster, “would have given the <em>coup de grace</em> to the proof of Christianity and undermined the foundations of the the legitimacy of the existence of Christianity.” “The Jews,” said St. Jerome, “promise each other the restoration of the city of Jerusalem in the end times: then, with waters flowing from the city to the two seas, circumcision will be practiced anew, sacrificial victims will be immolated, the precepts of the Law will be observed; it will not be the Jews who become Christians, but the Christians who become Jews.” (footnote: In <em>Zachar</em>, XIV, 9 et seq.)

<p>When the last descendant of Hillel died in 429, Zionist hopes were not extinguished, because the ethnarch or patriarch had as successor, until the Middle Ages, the exilarch, or the chief of the exiles of Babylon, the veritable chief of the Jews, even in the Roman Empire.

<p>Undoubtedly Judaism suffered from the intrusion into their affairs by the emperors of Constantinople, but much less, certainly, than Christianity.  There were treated as a protected sect.

<p>In the Middle Ages, the Jew was held in contempt.  He kept himself apart and was kept apart. Relegated to live in the ghetto, one can suspect that he nurtured the hope of one day taking his revenge.

<p>In our days the Jews, whose numbers seem to have increased to a dozen millions, enjoy in certain countries an above-average prosperity; in others, they are still kept apart by custom and opinion, or they fell (I must speak in the past tense) under the force of exceptional laws.  Even in certain nations where the Jew has acquired preponderance in business and where he enjoys equality under the law, he is rather often looked upon with an unkind smile.

<p>It was this situation that a Jew born in Budapest in 1860, Theodor Herzl, took advantage of to create the Zionist movement, whose goal was the founding of a Jewish nationality, a political Jewish State where the Israelites would impose themselves upon the regard of the world and reinstate themselves.  For Herzl it was about a modern State that could be established, in a pinch, in another country than Palestine.

<p>Zionism had its detractors among the Israelites. “Nevertheless,” wrote Rev. Fr. Lagrange in an article in <em>Correspondant</em> (footnote: April. 10, 1918, p.17) that I have just recapped, “it grew by a force that its initiator had not suspected, the religious faith of Jews, especially the Jews of Russia.  These had planned nothing and predicted nothing.  They did not know what might be a concession of the Sultan, or a Colonization Bank.  But, each day, they begged the Lord for a return to Zion.  When Herzl proposed to them, as an interim solution, to establish themselves in Uganda, their tragic disappointment obliged him to recoil and finally completed the breaking of his energy. At his death (July 1904), all his plans were washed up and his proposal had been proven unrealizable, but an immense hope in the restoration of Zion survived.

<p>“The clever ones continued to see nothing, to understand nothing, being sure they understood everything.  They knew that the Jews were little inclined to quit their businesses, to renounce their well-being, to go live miserably in Palestine.  Their god, it was said, is money; and their Temple, the stock exchange.

<p>“But it is typical of the clever to misperceive profound movements that arouse the masses, which they term mystical to excuse their having failed to recognize their energy ...

<p>“There are materialistic Jews, there are prudent ones, informed ones, calculating ones; but it would be unjust to this race, and ignorant of its history, to fail to attribute an  élan of idealism, or, if you wish, nationalism, ardent to the point of heroism - one might say almost to the point of folly. The state of humiliation in which the Jew lived during the centuries developed in him a foresighted calculating nature, at the expense of combativeness, but are we sure that combativeness is not latently preserved, awaiting the occasion to these pretentions of universal domination that have remained the dream of every ghetto?”

<p>If you doubt the combativeness of Jews, listen to what the rabbis of Jerusalem say: “We have the right, we are masters of our own house, we will boycott those who attempt to resist us.” There may well be a bit of bravado in these words, but it remains certain that the Jew knows what he wants and that he will easily be intolerant.

<p>That is how, on November 2, 1917, he obtained of the London government the declaration called Balfour’s, whose importance is difficult to exaggerate...

[text of the Balfour Declaration]

<p>In rereading the text, one can understand the Jewish enthusiasm that manifested itself the moment it was published, and upon the two anniversaries of this already famous declaration.  “What an unexpected oracle, what a miracle of Providence!” writes Rev. Fr. Lagrange.  “In this earthquake shaking the earth’s foundations, when the whole world was in suffering, when the persecuting Empire, the Empire of <em>pogroms</em> was collapsing more lamentably than Babylon, a new Cyrus shows the Jews the way to Holy Zion.  Is it to bring them back, that God has opened the way among such ruins? The Lord said:

<p>I will bring the race back from the East,
<p>And I will reassemble them from the West.
<p>I will say to the North: Give them up!
<p>And to the South: No holding them back!
<p>Make my sons come from faraway lands
<p>And my daughters from the ends of the earth.

<p>“All that is mysticism, but this mysticism is shaking millions of men.  A dream, a mirage, I would willingly consider it, but at this time it is triumphing over the scribes and the prudent ones.  Because it really is necessary that the leaders follow, as Ledru-Rollin said, when the troops are so determined to march.  Now, that is what they are, and the leaders cannot refuse to go along.  All that the spiritual masters can manage, and just recently the oracles of Judaism, is to moderate the explosion of joy, to remove from it what might be provocative and aggressive.” (footnote: Rev. Fr. Lagrange, op. cit.) 

<p>The <em>Univers Israélite</em> promises us “that the universal empire assured to the Jews will not be exploitation of Gentiles for the profit of a nation; no, the Jews have the mission to do good for the world, and that is why they have the right of empire.”

<p>“If that is where the moderate spirits are at, if they are constrained to associate themselves with a ‘quivering of rejoicing’ which does not allow for worrying, then what do the masses think?  This people of whom it is repeated unceasingly that they are persecuted, mocked, scorned for centuries by Christians, of whom one is thus accustomed to mix the instincts of revenge with the zeal of its interests, with its faithfulness to its God, will it preserve its sang-froid in the inebriation of such a hope?  Will it not have to wish passionately for the humiliation of Christianity in its turn, for vengeance?... The noblest and highest souls are not, to be sure, much more numerous in Israel than elsewhere... thus one encounters the response and the danger.” (footnote: Lagrange, op. cit.)

<p>I know, the intellectual leaders of Judaism see the inconvenience of an exclusive nationalism and dream of establishing in Palestine, in preference to a Jewish State, a religious center, in the hope that “the Law will go forth anew from Zion and from Jerusalem the divine word.” ...

<p>II.  Current Actions

<p>Let us leave these summits to look at what is happening in Jerusalem.  The Jews are arriving. From the 25,000 to 30,000 who were in the Holy City as of December 9, 1917, they appear to have re-attained the figure of 70,000, their number, it would seem, before the war, perhaps they have even surpassed it. They are refounding their ancient organization, and they are perfecting it. Worker houses are providing lodging at reduced price to new arrivals.  All the available rentals have been retained in advance by a Committee that pays the rent, all the while leaving them empty, which has produced a veritable housing crisis this year.  I do not consider it indiscreet to cite the case of the Franciscan Sisters of Mary, who have to pay annually a sum of 500 Egyptian pounds (13,000 Francs or 21,000 at the current exchange rate) for a house with no grounds and, on the whole, rather limited dimensions.

<p>The Jews are making themselves, one is assured, owners of great expanses of land in all of Palestine, and, when the rules against buying or selling are lifted, matters will undoubtedly escalate to an even vaster scale.  The farmer, it is true, is attached to the soil, but a certain number of farmers have debts; they allow themselves to be tempted by seductive offers that the Committee will make with its enormous financial resources. As for the rich bourgeois of the cities, who have acquired lands for purposes of speculation, is it a calumny to predict the facility with which they will allow these lands to be purchased, provided a good price is offered?  The lands, once sold, will never again return to Christians or Muslims, because the only legal proprietor is the Israelite Committee, which will only cede them to its coreligionists.

<p>Commerce, including that in pious articles, is falling and will fall ever more into the hands of Jews, whose aptitude is proverbial, and who have at their disposition considerable funds loaned to them at rates of 3% by banks devoted to them (while the non-Jews must submit to rates of 10 or 12%, or even more), and who benefit from favorable prices offered them by big monopolists.

<p>I do not insist upon the hospital and scholarly works founded by the Jews, because the Christians have similar works at their disposal.  But I must recount that last year a parcel was purchased on the Mount of Olives, where the first stone of the Hebrew University was solemnly laid.  Already public works and employment are for the most part in the hands of Jews.  What will it be on the day when their political establishment will have been more explicitly and definitively recognized, and when diplomas will be issued en masse from the new University!  One can be assured that, to keep Christians and Muslims from public functions, the Jews will have their coreligionists accepted for honors of which they are manifestly unworthy, for which they will pay the fees by tapping the treasury of the Committee of Jewish expansion.

<p>In sum, these are the sorrowful manifestations of the Zionist expansion in Palestine from an economic point of view.

<p>The day is perhaps not far off when the Muslim countrymen could become the day laborers on their former lands and when the Christian and Muslim populations are forced to emigrate in order to live.  Forced to emigrate!  Words we have often heard under the Turkish domination, and which are being pronounced again today.  Please God that we not hear them the more often as the Jews are the more strongly established in the land!

<p>The Christians, relatively small in numbers and too apathetic, the Muslims, even less prepared to endure the shock of such a powerful organization animated by the winds of religious enthusiasm and nationalism, will they resist?  Doubt appears permissible.

<p>What will be more humiliating for Christianity is to see invaded by the Jews, and falling under their political yoke, the Holy Places where it was born, these Holy Places where its vitality was brilliantly manifested in the time of the Christian emperors of Constantinople, these Holy Places that the Crusaders tried heroically to deliver from the power of the infidels, these Holy Places, finally, which were in recent times the witnesses of a magnificent development of Catholic and Christian charity.

<p>I dare not deal with the very delicate question of the greatly increased liberty as to morals that Jewish immigration will contribute to introducing in this corner of the Orient, which were until recently restrained.  Where are the conditions, so near and so far at the same time, whereby immorality will not dare to display itself publicly, and where the houses of toleration were themselves unknown?

<p>III. Precautions to Take Today and Tomorrow

<p>I now broach the most difficult part of this exposé.  If Jewish immigration develops normally (and one can expect to see Palestine invaded by Jewish floods from Romania and Russia), the Christians will be quickly submerged.  Nevertheless, all hope is not lost, because, finally, the immigrants will find difficulties for themselves as well, and it is not certain that the initial enthusiasm will not diminish progressively, at the same time as the material resources sent from Europe and America.  There is no need to give up, but, on the contrary, to accept the struggle that Providence imposes.

<p>The first remedy to attempt against the dangers that menace the future of Catholicism and also of Christianity in this land where it was born, is to create a <em>public opinion</em> in the civilized countries. These countries are emerging from a nightmare, and they are emerging more or less wounded. They are gripped by very serious and pressing anxieties. Above all, it is a matter of living and raising the accumulated ruins.  And yet it is essential to give a response to the moving plea of the Sovereign Pontiff, it is essential to speak to these Christian nations of the Christian ideal, of the shame that it would be to allow the cradle of their religion, of this religion that has made their strength and their greatness, to fall under the political domination, disguised or not, of Judaism.

<p>A second remedy would be perhaps to <em>reach agreement among missionaries of various denominations</em> (Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants) and Moslem religious authorities, to persuade countrymen not to sell their lands to Jews, taking into account that these lands will later have acquired a much greater value. <em>A bank</em> that makes advances secured by land, at a low interest rate, advancing sums of money to countrymen in need, would be a most desirable thing.  But I admit that the realization seems to me most difficult.

<p>In the meanwhile, a simple <em>savings and loan</em> would render precious services.  But it will not be easy to have it accepted as a practical matter by the indigenous people.  What they would like is exactly the opposite: to know great capital, difficult to find and which their inexperience would quickly dissipate.

<p>Finally (I must say above all), <em>unity among Christians and between Christians and Muslims</em> presents itself as a necessity for salvation.

<p>Let us say in conclusion, the politicians would be better advised to obstruct the progress of Zionist immigration than to facilitate it, in order to avoid struggling soon in inextricable difficulties: in Palestine, where 700,000 indigenous persons, Christians and Muslims, might not allow foreigners to come and lay down the law; in all the other countries of the world, where the antisemitic movement is reawakening and where, by the force of things, the Jews, having a refashioned country somewhere else, could no longer be considered as nationals of those countries.

<blockquote>“Masses and Führer”

<p>In times of a people’s greatest need, only great leaders can help.  There is complaining among us that they are nowhere to be found.  They must be born, some console themselves, and that is something no one can force to happen.  The genius, of course, flashes out in the darkness, unexpected, with no preparation, a gift of nature, God’s gift to humanity.  So too the leader whose like has not been seen for centuries, who is enormously creative with a master hand, who streams forth thoughts and deeds from a fullness of spirit and power, who appears  unmediated and unconquerable.  But these human wonders are not the only capabilities for leadership.  There are, alongside the common average and the boring mediocrity, powerful ones who tower above, light-bearers who are strong in themselves, who stride toward the sun and lead toward the sun.  They are significant, but not incomparable; they have brought along into the world a secret of power and mastery, towards which their effectiveness and momentum flow, however, only through training and experience.  They can be formed as leaders, their form must really be chiseled out of the marble, because limbs and features, clothes and posture, are only hinted at in their being and await their completion.

<p>The training of leaders is the greatest task of the future.  It stands in the ranks of the most important duties.  Whoever spends just a few years to train up a dozen virtuous leaders has fulfilled a more valuable duty than if he had guided hundreds of fellow travelers through the struggle of life.   For the endurance of the masses is faltering, and their influence is trifling.  There is a lack of capable, resolute, tenacious leaders who stand watch over the fire with the bellows, to heat it and stir it up, to awaken the dying embers from amidst the ashes.  Their flaming breath nourishes the chilled zeal of those who are easy come, easy go, of the burdened souls, of the hesitant.  They accomplish hundred-fold work.  The circle whose outer bounds are reached by the hand of the capable leader is incomparably greater than the narrow enclosures of a whole crowd of mediocrities...

<p>p.342: Leaders are to be taken from among the youth leaders and the youth associations, from the party leadership and parties, from academic circles and practical schools and from their leaders, from the circles of clergy and religious orders...

<p>p.348: A noteworthy new direction is winning the day in the specialized training of leaders.  In politicians’ circles, there is increasing talk of the logical and dialectical formation of leaders. [footnote: Especially noteworthy in this regard is the article: “The School of Statesmen” by W. von Massow in the Preussische Jahrbüchern, vol. 177 (Aug. 1919), pp. 165 ff., and in the book by Dr. H. Schidkunz, The Formation of a Politician (Berlin, 1919, Dümmler).] The lack of a rich spiritual foundation has all too often harmed us…

<p>p.349: What is demanded here for politicians is necessary for all leaders…

<p>In all fields, the thoughtlessness of the masses must be bounded by the cultivation of logical thought, and their superstitious devotion to slogans extinguished by the brightness of a refuting and uplifting word of truth.  That is the task of all logically and dialectically trained leaders of the future, filled with moral strength and earnestness.

<a name="45c"></a><p><strong>Feb. 4, 1920</strong> 19-Point Memorandum of Pacelli, “Punktation II”:

<blockquote>1. The Church has the full and free right to appoint to all Church offices without involvement of the State or the Communiities. The private Patronato right remains preserved intact, to the extent that it is still lawful according to the provisions of Canon Law.

<p>2. For the appointment of professors of the theological faculties in the universities, there must be advance consent from the Diocesan Bishop. 

<p>In consideration of students of philosophy who intend to devote themselves to the study of theology, there shall be employed in the philosophical faculties of the Universities of Munich and Würzburg at least one professor of philosophy and one professor of history whose Catholic standpoint is sound in the judgment of the Diocesan Bishop.

<p>3. Professors in the Lyceums are appointed by the Government upon the recommendation of the Diocesan Bishop. In their internal administration the Lyceums are subject to the Bishop.

<p>4. Religious instruction remains in all middle schools a subject of the curriculum. The religion teachers in these schools will be appointed, upon the Bishop’s recommendation, by the Government, which provides the necessary means for them.

<p>5. Professors of the theological faculties and lyceums, and religion teachers whom the Diocesan Bishop considers incapable or unsuited to continue in their teaching position by reason of their doctrine or moral conduct will be removed from their position.

<p>6. The State provides for a sufficient number of Catholic male and female teacher training institutes. Teachers who want to be employed in Catholic schools must attend these institutes and participate in religious instruction during their entire time of formation.
<p>The private teacher training institutes are on an equal basis with the governmental ones, if they fulfill the same requirements.

<p>7. For access to teaching positions and for employment in primary schools or higher teaching positions, members of orders and religious congregations will be subject to no different requirements than lay persons.

<p>8. In all Communities where parents or others responsible for childrearing submit a proposal, Catholic elementary schools must be erected, insofar as a sufficient number of students is reported for them.

<p>9. In all primary schools religious instruction remains a subject of the curriculum in its previous dimensions. For students in the primary schools as in higher learning institutions, opportunity must be given for the fulfillment of their religious obligations.

<p>10. Oversight of religious instruction and religious-moral life in the primary and middle schools belongs to the Diocesan Bishop. He exercises it either directly in his own person or via his delegees. The Bishop submits his complaints, based on observations made, or his proposals, to the State Government, which effects what is necessary to resolve them.

<p>11. Orders and religious congregations are authorized, under the general legislative provisions, to found and conduct private schools. These private schools give the same titles as the governmental ones.

<p>12. The Bavarian State will fulfill for the future its property-law-based obligations resting on law, treaty or particular title of right toward the Catholic Church. Expressly declared as such titles of right are, among other things, the Herkommen agreement, the Concordat of 1817 and the property-law-based obligations recognized by the Reich Deputation Main Committee itself. In the discharge of these obligations, the Bavarian State will take into account changes in the value of money and actual needs, and especially the so-called facultative and revocable State subsidies. Payments must occur in a form that avoids the effects of a rapid devaluation. Moreover, those Concordat-imposed obligations that the State has formerly not fulfilled or not sufficiently fulfilled will also be taken into consideration.

<p>13. Governmental buildings and real estate that currently serve Church purposes directly or indirectly will be left to the Church free of charge for continuing and unrestricted use. The State will fulfill its obligations for building maintenance in their previous dimensions for the future and will take responsibility in cases of need for new buildings.

<p>14. The Church’s property and its property rights remain secured forever.

<p>15. The Church has the right to raise taxes. The State will raise these taxes together with State taxes in return for equitable compensation.

<p>16. For the army, penal institutions and caring institutions as well as hospitals, a regular pastoral care will be set up. To the extent institutions of the Bavarian State are involved, it will provide the necessary means to support pastoral care and worship.

<p>17. The State undertakes the obligation to recognize the order of Church authorities within the sphere of their competence and in case of need for implementation of the same, guarantees its support whenever this is requested.

<p>18. In the exercise of their office, clergy enjoy the protection of the State, which will not allow, but rather punish, calumnies against their person and disturbances of their conduct of office.

<p>19. Orders and religious congregations can be freely founded and are subject to no restriction by the State in relation to their establishments and the number of their members. To the extent they have previously enjoyed the rights of a public corporation, these remain guaranteed to them; the others acquire and retain legal capacity or the rights of a public corporation according to provisions of law that are applicable to all citizens or societies. Their property and their other rights are guaranteed to them. They administer their property and order their affairs independent of the State.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Your Excellency!

<p>Most Reverend Herr Archbishop!

<p>With Letter No. 14,899 of November 28th this past year, I allowed myself to share confidentially with the most reverend Archbishops and Bishops of Bavaria the points that are to form the articles for the upcoming agreement between the Holy See and the Bavarian Government, so as to enable the most reverend supreme shepherds to express their authoritative views.

<p>The kindly expressed observations already given by the most reverend supreme shepherds, as well as further studies and incisive counsels, have suggested several modifications and additions. The revised points were recently submitted by me to the judgment of the Holy See, and the Holy See has found itself moved to approve these as “sehr gut.” Frankly, whether the recommended points will be attainable is another question and hardly can be hoped; but nevertheless one must ask for what is fair and right.

<p>Since Herr Minister President Hoffmann asked that the Holy See express its desires as to the content and form of the negotiations for the new agreement , the aforementioned points have been submitted by me in the name of the Holy See to the said Herr Minister with Letter No. 15,750 of the 4th of this month.

<p>As to what concerns the formal aspect, I have likewise received authorization to share with Herr Hoffmann that negotiations about agreements with the Holy See customarily are accomplished in Rome, but that, in order to accommodate the Bavarian Government in every way, the Holy See is prepared to conduct them in this case in Munich itself and has entrusted me for this as its representative.

<p>I hasten now to hand Your Excellency a confidential copy of the aforementioned points and it would be ever appreciated if You, as before, would share with me Your wise counsel in this so difficult and important matter, on which the future of the Catholic Church in our beloved Bavaria depends.

<p>I believe it superfluous to put it to Your Excellency how it is the constant principle of the Holy See to stay remote from all purely political questions and thus, how no statement would have been made by It to the effect indicated. It would desire, therefore, to deny publicly what Dr. Heim has attributed to the Holy See, in the event, to be sure, that it would turn out that he publicly expressed such a thought. If it is shown that he did this privately, Your Excellency may arrange to make known, in a confidential manner, the complete groundlessness of his affirmation.  In any case, since it is reported that the attitude attributed to the Holy See by Dr. Heim has made a profound impression on the lower clergy of Bavaria, see to it, Your Excellency, how best to correct that impression...</blockquote>

<p>Note: This communiqué may have been given to Nuncio Pacelli in Rome rather than transmitted to Munich.  Pacelli traveled to Rome around February 10, 1920, the date of his mother’s death.  He did not return to Munich until two months later, arriving on the night before April 12, 1920, according to the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em> of that date. On March 5, 1920, the Auditor of the Munich Nunciature, Msgr. Schioppa, wrote Cardinal Gasparri that he had just received the Feb. 14 communiqué.  See below.</blockquote><br><br>


<a name="46a"></a><p><strong>Feb. 14, 1920</strong> Schioppa, Auditor of Munich Nunciature, to Gasparri:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Baron Cramer-Klett came to see me upon his return from Berlin, where he had gone at the request of the Government to confer in general on the conditions in Italy and in particular on the question of German Representation at the Holy See. The aforesaid Baron charged me to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence how he carried out his duty to say what would be the current point of view of the Central Government concerning said Representation, subject to awaiting the decision that Prussia will take in this regard.

<p>The Reich Government is very much inclined to transform the Prussian Legation at the Holy See into an Embassy; and, to support the venerated desire of the Holy Father, would be disposed to have the Bavarian Legation remain alongside this Embassy, but <em>only temporarily</em> (provisionally), that is, so long as the all the issues arising in Bavaria in consequence of the well-known political changes have not been completely resolved with the Holy See.  In this sense, the Bavarian People’s Party would have to work to overcome the difficulties that will certainly be put forward by Minister-President Hoffmann, who has already spoken in some way for the abolition of the aforesaid Bavarian Legation (see Report No. 15420), and Cramer-Klett has therefore spoken in this regard with one of the Leaders of the mentioned Party, who promised him to act in this direction.

<p>The Baron believes that this proposal could be accepted; 1st) because if the Prussian Legation were not transformed into a German Embassy, the “Reich,” as such, would not be represented at the Holy See, since until now the prevailing tendency is that the “Reich” itself should not be considered more unitary with Prussia; and thus the aforesaid Legation could not per se represent more than just Prussia; 2nd) because it can easily be foreseen that the solution of issues alluded to between Bavaria and the Holy See will proceed at great length and thus an abolition of the Bavarian Legation is not to be feared in the near future; 3rd) because, once the German Embassy is created, it does not seem possible that a new reduction of the rank of the Legation would follow, in case the Bavarian Government would ask, in consequence, that its provisional Legation at the Holy See would become permanent; finally 4th) because the <em>status quo ante</em> is no longer possible.  The Central Government has every interest in showing that Prussia no longer has hegemony in Germany.  A Prussian Legation at the Holy See would now represent just the opposite.

<p>The same Baron told me that the Archbishop of Munich, to whom he has spoken of the matter, expressed a view contrary to his proposed solution, fearing that the enemies of the Church in Bavaria could take advantage of the <em>provisional</em> situation of the Bavarian Diplomatic Representative at the Holy See as an occasion to demand its suppression.  The Baron, however, does not share this fear of Archbishop von Faulhaber and believes the proposal from Berlin can definitely be accepted, in the event, naturally, that the Holy Father deigns to approve it. Meanwhile, Baron Cramer-Klett would like to know the August Thought of His Holiness in this regard.  He believes that if the Central Government could eventually say to Prussia that this is indeed the desire of the Holy See, it would perhaps be easier to obtain its consent.

<p>My interlocutor further said to me that Mr. von Grünau, the Relator for Vatican Affairs at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, told him that the German Government will strongly desire the creation of a Nunciature in Berlin, not at all in opposition to the continuance of that in Munich, and would urgently desire that this Berlin Nunciature be made a fait accompli as soon as possible, so that the Apostolic Nuncio can be given precedence over the other Diplomatic Representatives, who currently are only Chargés d'Affaires and who later, when they are eventually elevated to the rank of Ministers or Ambassadors, will have to acknowledge the indisputable precedence acquired by the Pontifical Representative.

<p>Finally, the aforementioned Baron told me that, having spoken about the issue with Minister Erzberger who assured him - with his accustomed optimism - that with the first of next March the Prussian Legation at the Holy See should be transformed into the German Embassy.

<p>The origin of the Freemasons is usually placed back in the 18th century in England ...

<p>That the Freemasons want to rule is also explained by their hatred toward the “infamy.”  This class of men does not sympathize with the Christian religion ...

<p>But the striving for dominion by the Freemasons and those in solidarity with them for attaining their goal in the various states demands yet a further explanatory cause.

<p>The Freemasons recruit in great measure from the influential, well-capitalized adherents of Jewry.  The Christian Middle Ages rejected persecution of Jews... But the princes and people protected themselves against the exploitation and arrogance of many Jews.  And the Christian Middle Ages certainly never conceded to Jews complete social and political equality with Christians.

<p>For the Christian Middle Ages regarded the Jews as a particular nationality, not merely as a religious group ...

<p>The [Masonic] Lodge-Jews have brought with them this spirit of sticking together and belonging together... and they keep this from the Talmud: “God gave all peoples (thus dominion over them) and their property to the Israelites.”

<blockquote>“Archbishop’s Decrees”

<p>In connection with this year’s pastoral letter, His Excellency the Most Reverend Lord Archbishop issues the following:

<p><strong>Fasting Duty.</strong> Abstinence, that is abstaining from meat dishes, all Catholics have to observe on all Fridays of the year, except when Friday falls on a prescribed feast day...

<p><strong>Easter Duty.</strong> All Catholics in the Archdiocese must, during the Easter season, that is from the 3rd Sunday of Lent through the 3rd Sunday after Easter (March 7th to April 25th), receive the Holy Sacraments of Confession and Eucharist.  Whoever fails to receive Easter Communion and dies without having come to confess this failure, will be shut out from Church burial.

<p><strong>Marriage under the Blessing of the Church.</strong> Engaged couples shall go to the office of the parish they belong to, and present a copy of their baptismal certificate, before notifying the state registry office.  Catholics can only enter into a valid marriage before their Catholic pastor or his vicar.  A validly entered marriage remains absolutely indissoluble until the death of one of the spouses; thus a re-marriage during the lifetime of the spouses is impossible, even if a divorce has been decreed by a civil court.  A Church dispensation for entry into a mixed marriage will only be given if the Catholic upbringing of all children is guaranteed by a notarized contract.  Whoever does not have his children baptized and raised Catholic thereby cuts himself off from the Catholic Church.

<p><strong>Religious Upbringing and Religious Life.</strong> Catholic parents are obligated by conscience to have all their children take part in Catholic religious instruction and to send them, insofar as possible, to a Catholic denominational school...

<p>Participation in gatherings of Adventists, Spiritists and other opponents of the Church, as well as reading their writings and books, is forbidden under punishment of excommunication.

<p>Resigning from the Church and falling away from the faith have been considered since Apostolic times to be very grave sins; they incur excommunication with all its consequences.  Papers that endanger faith and morals and attack the Church may not be possessed or read by Catholics.

<p><strong>Associations for Each State in Life.</strong> Youth, just like children, should enroll in a Catholic association corresponding to their state in life.  Such associations have been established in nearly all parishes of the Archdiocese.  Especially recommended for youth are the Catholic Youth Association ... for students the Catholic Student Congregation ... for domestics servants in the province the Catholic Servants’ Association ... for laborers the Catholic Men’s Worker Association or the Catholic Women’s Worker Association ... for business-oriented vocations the Catholic Business Association Hansa or Young Hansa ... and the Association for Female Business Office Workers and Helpers ..., for women the Catholic Women’s League ...

<p>Those who want to travel abroad may turn to the office of the Association for Catholic Germany Abroad ... Single women who move into the city alone are exposed to great dangers.  They should report their arrival to the Marian Single Women’s Protection Association, by means of a card that can be picked up at the train station.

<p>For poor, crippled, physically or morally endangered or neglected children and youth, care is provided by the Catholic Youth Care Association of the Archdiocese ... 

<p><strong>Church Burial.</strong> For the seriouslly ill, clergy should be called in a timely manner.  Catholics who have given instructions for their body to be cremated are shut out, unless they revoke such instructions, from the Sacrament of Last Rites.  Also, upon their death, no funeral mass can be conducted for them.</blockquote>

<a name="47e"></a><p><strong>Feb. 16, 1920</strong> Faulhaber to Ambassador Baron Otto von Ritter zu Groenesteyn:

<blockquote>Most esteemed Herr Baron!

<p>Up to now I have not expressed myself about pending issues because everything here is still unclear and in continual flux, and because one hears from many quarters that the postal police at the Bavarian borders open letters.  Meanwhile you have had occasion to discuss our pressing issues with the Lord Nuncio personally, thus in a much more authentic manner. It has been a fight to the finish for me to win and prevent the surrender of the Bavarian Embassy to the Vatican:

<p>On January 15th Count Zech was with me and told me that the Prussian National Assembly, which is currently setting the record for particularism, will hold onto their Prussian Embassy so long as Bavaria sticks with its Embassy. I was able to answer him that Bavaria really possesses here an entirely different Church law basis in its Concordat and Nunciature, and could also point to an entirely different title of right in Church history.

<p>On February 13th Baron von Cramer-Klett came to me direct from Berlin and tried to win me over in the first place for a Reich Embassy that would carry water for the other Catholic provinces of the Reich, and for this additionally: The Bavarian Embassy could, until further notice, be maintained. I had to answer him: In the meantime the position of the Holy See has been established in two articles, “either a new embassy while maintaining the previous one, or the status quo ante,” and I did not consider myself entitled to twist the meaning by adding anything. In Berlin it was said to him that a status quo ante is now impossible on account of the totally changed personal relationships in the leadership of Prussia and the Reich.

<p>The Bavarian Volkspartei states that it was not to be previously consulted on the issue, and if the assertion to that effect in the well-known letter to Berlin ever comes to be publicly examined, there will be quarrels here or there.  The Lord Nuncio is clear on the issue and has walked a straight path, and we cannot be thankful enough to him for that.  Shortsighted politicians will let themselves be caught up in the view that the Reich Nuncio should be kept in Munich. Essentially, however, a Reich Nunciature in Munich would mean the same annihilation of the last Bavarian special right, and the same Reich-ifying, or better said, impoverishment, of the Church in Bavaria, as would be done by having the Reich Nunciature in Berlin.

<p>I still continue to trust that Vatican diplomacy, which has shown itself under Eminence Gasparri to be so magnificent in recent years in superlative ways, will indeed not cooperate with all the political somersaults and will think especially of the future. In any case, these days and their outcome have a long-term significance.  More on this and other issues, I do not venture to allow myself, at the same time Your Excellency can draw more from the primary source.

<p>With the expression of my most upright respect, I remain

<p>Your Excellency’s Most Devoted,

Faulhaber to Schioppa:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Herr Prelate!

<p>With devoted thanks I confirm the receipt of the 19 negotiating points under confidentiality. In the permanent advisory commission that exists here to advise the political authorities, we will take this up in detail on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. At the same time I am in correspondence with the Lord Archbishop of Bamberg in order to achieve a common position of the Bavarian Bishops. However, since the principles for the dissolution will be established by the Reich, and the Bavarian Education Minister will seek in this field, as in the school issue, to attain via the Reich what he cannot attain in Bavaria, it will be necessary to bring about an agreed position with the Bishops of the entire Reich well before the establishment of the Reich principles. Also in that the Lord Archbishop of Bamberg is of the same opinion. The situation is exceedingly serious, and all personal considerations must be set aside to the utmost in order to effect more freedom for the Church in Bavaria than in the Concordat of 100 years ago.

<a name="48"></a><p><strong>Feb. 24, 1920</strong> Nazi Party program:

<blockquote>1. We demand the unification of all Germans into a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of peoples.

<p>2. We demand equality of rights for the German <em>Volk</em> with respect to other nations, and annulment of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.

<p>3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our <em>Volk</em>, and colonization for our surplus population.

<p>4. Citizens can only be those who are members of the <em>Volk</em>. A member of the <em>Volk</em> can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of denomination. Therefore no Jew can be a member of the <em>Volk</em>.

<p>5. Whoever is not a citizen shall be able to live in Germany only as a guest, and must be subject to legislation concerning foreigners.

<p>6. The right to decide about leadership and laws of the State may only belong to a citizen.  Therefore we demand that all public offices, no matter what kind, whether in the Reich, the states, or the local communities, may be occupied only by citizens.  We combat the corrupting parliamentary system of filling positions only according to party affiliations without consideration of character or abilities.

<p>7. We demand that the State be obligated first of all to provide opportunity for livelihood and living for the citizens. If it is not possible to sustain the entire population of the State, then the adherents of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich.

<p>8. All further immigration of non-Germans is to be prevented.  We demand that all non-Germans who have immigrated to Germany since August 2, 1914, be forced to leave the Reich immediately.

<p>9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.

<p>10. The first obligation of every citizen must be to produce both mentally and physically.  The activity of the individual may not violate the interests of the common good, but rather must operate within the framework of the whole and for the benefit of all.</p>

<center><strong>Therefore we demand:</strong></center>

<p>11. Abolition of income not earned by work and labor.</p>

<center><strong>Breaking of interest-slavery.</strong></center>

<p>12. In consideration of the enormous sacrifice in property and blood that every war demands of the <em>Volk</em>, personal enrichment through war must be branded a crime against the <em>Volk</em>. Therefore we demand the complete confiscation of all war profits.

<p>13. We demand the nationalization of all (previously) incorporated enterprises (trusts).

<p>14. We demand profit-sharing by large enterprises.

<p>15. We demand a large-scale expansion of public assistance for the elderly.

<p>16. We demand the establishment of a financially sound middle class and its preservation, immediate communalization of large warehouses and leasing of their space at low cost to small businesses, and the focused consideration of all small businesses for contracts with federal, state, and local government.

<p>17. We demand a land reform appropriate to our national needs, enactment of a law for uncompensated appropriation of land for purposes of the public interest, abolition of ground-rents and prevention of all land speculation.

<p>18. We demand uncompromising war against those whose activity violates the common good.  Common criminals against the <em>Volk</em>, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of denomination or race.

<p>19. We demand the replacement of Roman law, which serves a materialistic world order, by German common law.

<p>20. In order to enable every capable and diligent German to attain higher education and thereby a path into leading positions, the State is to bear the responsibility for a fundamental reconstruction of the entire educational program for our <em>Volk</em>. The instructional plans of all educational institutions are to be suited to the requirements of practical life.  A grasp of the concept of the State must be imparted by the school (citizenship education) from the earliest age of reason.  We demand State-funded education of especially intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of class or occupation.

<p>21. The State is responsible for improving national health by protection of mother and child, by prohibition of child labor, by encouragement of physical fitness by means of legal enactment of a duty to engage in gymnastics and sports, and by the utmost support for all associations concerned with the physical education of youth.

<p>22. We demand the abolition of mercenary troops and the formation of a <em>Volk</em>-army.

<p>23. We demand a legal war on verifiable lies and their promulgation by the press. In order to enable the establishment of a German press, we demand that: 

<blockquote>a) All writers and employees of newspapers published in the German language must be members of the <em>Volk</em>.

<p>b) Non-German newspapers need express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language.

<p>c) Any financial interest in German newspapers, or influence upon them, by non-Germans is forbidden by law and punishable, for a violation, by the closing of such a newspaper, as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the interested non-Germans. 

<p>Newspapers that violate the common good are to be forbidden.  We demand a legal war against artistic and literary forms that exert a destructive influence on the life of our <em>Volk</em> and the closing of organizations that violate the foregoing demands.</blockquote>

<p>24. We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the State, so long as they do not endanger its existence or offend against the morals and ethics of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to a particular denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our <em>Volk</em> can only succeed from the inside out on this foundation:</p>

<center><strong>common good before self-interest.</strong></center>

<p>25. For the execution of all this we demand the establishment of a strong central Reich power.  Unconditional authority of the central parliament over the entire Reich and all its organizations.  The formation of chambers by estates and occupations for implementing, in the individual states of the federation, the framework of laws decreed by the Reich. 

<p>The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary at the risk of their own lives, to work relentlessly for the realization of the foregoing points.

<blockquote>“A Jewish Secret Document”

   <p>In the Russian newspaper “Prizyv” (<em>The Call</em>) of February 6, 1920 is found the following significant article.  It says, in literal translation:

<p>In the hostile encounter with Bolshevik regiments on the Estonian border on December 9th of last year, an interesting document in the Yiddish language was found in the pocket of a fallen battalion commander of the 11th Infantry Regiment named Sunder, which tells us about the activity and secret organization of the Jews in Russia.  We quote it without alteration or commentary:

<blockquote>“Secret!  To the directors of the detachments of the International League of Israelites.

<p>“Sons of Israel!  The hour of our final victory is near!  We stand on the eve of our world domination.  That of which we could previously only dream, is being transformed into reality.  Recently still weak and helpless, we are now proudly lifting up our heads, thanks to revolution throughout the world.

<p>“Nevertheless we must be prudent, because it can be said with conviction that, having advanced over the destroyed altars and thrones, we now must continue yet further on the path we have determined.

<p>“We have subjected the authority and morals of the religion that is foreign to us to a relentless critique by successful propaganda.  We destroyed foreign holy places, we threw into confusion the cultures and traditions of countries and empires.  We did everything to subject the Russian people to our domination and to force them to fall on their knees before us.  We have attained nearly everything, nevertheless we must be prudent, because our worst enemy is subjugated Russia.  The victory that our spirit has carried off can yet be turned against us in the next generation.

<p>“Russia is totally destroyed and is completely in our power, but do not forget for a moment that we must be prudent!  The holy concern for our security allows for now sympathy and now mercy in us.  By means of taking their goods and possessions and gold, we have transformed this people into pitiful slaves.  Be careful and discreet!  We may not have pity on our enemies; we must eliminate the best and leading elements, so that subjugated Russia has no leaders.  Thereby we will destroy any possibility that they can recover their power.  We must arouse hatred among parties and incite a struggle between farmers and workers.

<p>“War and class struggle destroy the cultural treasures that have been created by the Christian peoples.  But be prudent, sons of Israel!  Our victory is near, because our political and economic power and our influence on the masses of people are growing stronger.  We are buying up gold and Reich bonds and thus have predominance in the stock exchanges of the world.  We have power in our hands, but be prudent!  Do not trust false and dark elements!

<p>“Bronstein, Apfelbaum, Rosenfeld, Steinberg – all of them, as many others also, are true sons of Israel!  Our power in Russia is unlimited.  In the cities, commissariats, provisioning offices, etc., the representatives of our nation play the main role.  Do not let yourselves be intoxicated by victory!  Be prudent, because no one can stand up for us except we ourselves.

<p>“Think of this, that the Red Army cannot be trusted, because it can suddenly turn its weapons against us.

<p>“Sons of Israel!  The hour of our long-sought victory over Russia is near!  Form tight ranks!  Preach loudly the national policy of our people!  Fight for our eternal ideals!”</blockquote>

   <p>The most secret goals of Judaism come to the fore, undisguised, in this secret circular letter of the Jews in Russia; who can doubt that the whole of Jewry throughout the world participates in this struggle with their innermost desires.  Thus is it entirely unthinkable that today’s Jews in Germany work hand in hand with the members of their race in Russia?

<blockquote>“Bolshevism and Jewry”
 
<p>Our lead essay in the next to last issue finds a significant complement by way of a notice in the “Silesian News,” no. 27.  The paper writes:  “The leading role of Jews in the introduction and spreading of Bolshevism has until now been disputed by interested elements and characterized as antisemitic or just agitation by Germans.  Thus it is noteworthy that the leadership of the Jews in the Revolution is not only openly admitted by Jewish elements, but even highlighted with a certain pride.”  Herr M. Kohan does this in an article, “The Service that Jewry has Rendered to the Worker,” in no. 7 of the “Communist” newspaper of April 12, 1919.  Secondly, it should be added that the “Communist” is published in the Russian city Charlow.  Herr Kohan’s article says:  “All possible reactionary and military elements and councils introduce land reforms, divide the land among the workers, establish the eight-hour workday and throw other bait to the workers, only in order to keep themselves in control ...  It can be said without exaggeration that the great Russian social revolution [<em>soziale Revolution</em>] was equally a work of the Jews.  And the Jews have not only led – no, still more, Soviet business rests in their dependable hands.  We can be at ease so long as the supreme command of the Red Army rests in the hands of Lev Trotsky.  It is true that the Jews do not serve as common soldiers in the ranks of the Red Army: but in the committees, in the councils of deputies and as commissars, the Jews audaciously and fearlessly lead the masses of the Russian proletariat to victory.  Not for nothing do the Jews press into all Soviet governing bodies by means of elections.  Not for nothing do we repeat that the Russian proletariat elects as head and leader the Jew Braunstein-Trotsky ...”  If Jewry, striving for world domination, blinds the masses to this, drives them into misery, and makes them serve the purposes of Jewry, then Jewry is the “representative of the proletariat released from the chains of slavery.”  If non-Jews and their colleagues from among their people collaborate to find a way toward the future, then it is “reactionary” elements doing this to “keep themselves in control.”  As the Jews, however, audaciously and fearlessly kept the war going in war societies and other positions, in the writing bureaus of the communications department, etc., then they are “audaciously and fearlessly” leading the masses of the proletariat, “in the committees, in the councils of deputies and as commissars,” to victory.  How long is the world going to keep letting themselves be taken for fools?

<blockquote>Most Reverend Lord Cardinal and Prince Bishop!

<p>Your Eminence was so kind as to send the minutes of the January Fulda Conference, for which I am most devotedly grateful, and to raise the issue whether, in consideration of the common momentous fate that presently binds together in solidarity the German North and South in Church- and school-issues, a closer liaison between the Prussian and Bavarian Episcopates might not be something to strive for, and whether the two Bishops Conferences of Fulda and Freising should enter into a closer relationship via a committee comprising both sides. In fact the new Reich Constitution casts the Church in North and South upon each other; otherwise the upcoming Reich school law will create the foundations for the schooling arrangements in the individual member States, and even the general principles for the dissolution laws of the individual States will be established by the Reich. All of that makes a mutual coming together about the basic contours of the Church’s demands imperative. .. For the participation of a Bavarian Bishop in the Fulda Conference, the Freising Conference has already imparted authority, as previously stated. A reciprocal representation of the Most Reverend Lords of Fulda at the Conference in Freising is something I will recommend at the first opportunity to the Bavarian Episcopate, and I do not doubt that it will welcome this reciprocal recommendation gratefully, as it is also an express desire of the Apostolic Nunciature. I will allow myself to share the result as soon as possible.

<p>The priest Dr. Eggersdorfer, professor and delegate of the Bavarian Volkspartei, will pull together a little handbook with the Church Canons, governmental decrees and other important announcements about schooling, and he asks me in that regard whether he may make reference to or quote from Your Eminence’s most recent memorandum about schooling, which unfortunately I do not have at hand, or whether that memorandum is for now in no way intended for the public.

<a name="50a"></a><p><strong>Feb. 26, 1920</strong> Faulhaber to the Bavarian Bishops:

<blockquote>Your Episcopal Graces!

<p>I. His Excellency the Archbishop of Bamberg has made a recommendation dated February 15th in reference to a decision of the extraordinary January Fulda Conference in Fulda, to institute a drafting commission under my chairmanship for preparatory consultations about the Church-State issues in Munich, such commission to consist of experts from the clergy and laymen who are loyal to the Church, and its memorandum to be presented in draft form to all the Bishops and Ordinariates for examination. As members of this drafting commission, Excellency von Hauck recommends: Auxiliary Bishop Senger, Prelate Buchberger, Prelate Pichler, Dr. Beyerle, Dr. von Knilling, Dr. von Haiss. In a letter from a Bavarian Ordinariate, however, reservations were raised against Dr. Beyerle on account of his optimistic view of the Reich Constitution and against Dr. von Knilling.  For the outstanding essay by Herr von Knilling in the last issue of the <em>Allgemeine Rundschau</em>, however, we can frankly only be grateful.  In the advisory commission that already exists in Munich, which at the moment is diligently at work and has discussed the 19 points for many hours, there are, in addition to myself: Prelate Buchberger, Cathedral Deacon Kiefl, Delegates Held, Wohlmuth and Eggersdorfer, along with Professors Eichmann and Scharnagl, Ministerial Counsel Goldenberger and two gentlemen from the Supreme Administrative Court. It is a question whether these could not now be set up with the confidential commission and material for the new mission in liaison with Dr. Senger and Dr. Pichler. 

<p>The most important matters for consultation are surely the following three:

<p>1. Foundations for the new drafting of the Concordat on the basis of the 19 points that were sent to the Most Reverend Lords on February 10th by the Nunciature. There still remains a one-sidedness and a major hindrance, that the Church side of the negotiation, at the request of the Minister President, made known its bottom line demands without the counter-demands of the governmental side being made known. It almost has the appearance that the Minister President only wanted to know the Church’s demands so he could better arm himself to attack them. In any event the Holy Father wants “una nuova convenzione” [Italian: a new concordat] for Bavaria, and on the part of the Cabinet Ministry, they are pushing to give the Church its walking papers [fn: German <em>Scheidebrief</em>, which appears in German translations of scripture for the Biblical/Judaic term meaning “bill of divorce”] if possible before the elections [which occurred on June 6, 1920]. The final negotiations about the new concordat are naturally a matter for the Apostolic See, but the Nunciature expressly desires to know the united joint view of the Bishops, and at the same time we jointly bear the responsibility for the long-term future.

<p>2. The general outlines for the dissolution. The details for the dissolution cannot yet be established today, so long as the counter-proposals from the governmental side are not known. Since, however, the State legislative implementation of Articles 137 and 138 follows from principles set down by the Reich, it is a matter now of setting up these principles around eminently Bavarian interests, as Minister Hoffmann is known to be seeking to attain via Berlin what he cannot attain for his goals in Bavaria. The Prussian Bishops have already set forth principles for the dissolution and instituted a drafting commission to handle them further.

<p>3. The Reich school conferences for preparation of the Reich school law. It will be very difficult if not impossible to overturn what is specified by the Reich school law in the field of schooling. The Stuttgart 8 points, reportedly authored by Minister Hoffmann, show with frightening clarity what we have to expect from the Reich in this regard; Hoffmann himself considers the current school conferences in Berlin to be so important that he begged off participating in the Ministerial trip to the Palatinate. In local educational circles the confessional curriculum is now coming under discussion.

<p>II. Excellency von Hauck makes the further recommendation: When the drafts of the drafting commission are ready at hand, the Bavarian Bishops should then gather for a conference regarding the draft and indeed in Munich, in order to be spared the time-consuming trip to and from Freising. All of this, naturally, as material for the Landtag delegates and as material for the final negotiations between Nunciature and State Government. I ask you most devotedly to express yourselves on this recommendation. For my part, the Most Reverend Lords would be most cordially welcomed in Munich as well as in Freising. As further points for a possible Bishops’ conference I would allow myself for now to recommend: Introduction of a State tax for the Church – protection of the religious orders that care for the sick, against revolutionary attaks – the new labor union strife among female helpers and office-holders in commerce – the Bishop-Graces of Eichstätt are of the opinion, in consideration of the travel difficulties to be expected currently, to question whether a Bishops’ conference will be considered necessary after examination of the commission’s draft.

<p>III. Cardinal Bertram of Breslau asked me at the charge of the extraordinary Fulda Bishops Conference whether, in consideration of the interest of solidarity of the Church in the North and the South, a representative from Bavaria to conferences of the Prussian Bishops should not be arranged, and vice versa.  The Apostolic Nunciature expressed to me the direct desire for that I have a working relationship with the other German Bishops in view of the common issues of the Reich Constitution and the Reich school law…

<p>IV. The Apostolic Nunciature assigned me to share a resolution of the Cardinal Secretary of State: “The extraordinary authorities conferred upon the Bishops by the Consistorial Congregation’s decree of April 25, 1918, which were to expire 6 months after the signing of a peace treaty, remain in effect regardless of the signing of the peace treaty that was concluded already on June 28, 1919.”

<p>V. On this occasion I have the honor to share with the Most Reverend Lords of Regensburg, Augsburg and Passau further information from the Consistorial Congregation of January 23, 1920: In consideration of the exchange rates and the great losses in changing Marks into Lira, the Holy Father wants to come to the aid of the German Bishops and therefore allows them, for taxes on rescripts, briefs and Apostolic Bulls, to exchange Marks according to their nominal value in Lira, thus 10 Marks = 10 Lira …

<p>Since I have received from America a wealth of free-will gifts in money and especially in high mass stipends, I am in a position to send stipends to the Most Reverend Lords in a discreet manner for special instances of poverty, including those of clergy. The extremely sad fact that the yield of the Papal international assembly for the Day of the Innocent Child is to be distributed by the Swiss Committee of the Red Cross, headed by an English Protestant woman, has surely become directly known by the Most Reverend Lords. I have written the Caritas office in Freiburg that during the war we had painful disputes precisely with the Red Cross on account of its inter-confessional care for youth, and that in my opinion the Bishops are the hands of the Pope not merely to collect but also once again to distribute.

<p>With official fraternal greeting and in upright highest respect I remain,

<a name="51"></a><p><strong>Feb. 29, 1920</strong> Faulhaber to Prince Wilhelm von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen

<blockquote>Your Royal Highness

<p>may I ask most respectfully for pardon that I only today for the first time am thanking you for the most graceful letter and allowing myself to reciprocate from the heart the best wishes for blessing for the person and the entire house of Your Royal Highness. The typewriter is excellent and disgorges its dictated letters like a threshing machine its bales of straw, but the hand is cramped from writing and does not let itself be convinced by the best of reasoning that its writing strike, in the face of its obligations, is a crime. Just as our Lord God delights from time to time in sending again a great consolation to make us strong again for the hours of the cross, so it was also a grace-filled gift that on the Feast of Christmas this year, in the castle of Sigmaringen, the martyr of Malta had returned home after long, bitter separation.

<p>I spent the time around New Year’s Day in Rome in the quiet Anima, which is finally returning from Italian occupation to its former lords; in Church circles “Tedesco” [Italian word for German] is taken in an entirely good way, and the Holy Father spoke with sincere goodwill of the situation in Germany. Of the much-touted pro-German nature of the Italians I actually tasted very little, and I consider it only the flip-side of being fed up with the French, which currently motivates the Italians on account of the Fiume issue and other matters that rub them the wrong way. On the whole they regard our situation as not so bad and consider our cries for help as a political maneuver to arouse sympathy, and that is really the most discouraging aspect of the story, that we are generally no longer believed. The military plays part of the street scene of Rome, and on the train plays a heroic role much different from previous times, so we have militarism in a different uniform. To judge by confidential reports inside the Vatican, we have only the farsighted preventive diplomacy of the Pope to thank that the Kaiser was not extradited.

<p>Your Royal Highness has confidence, and I rejoice in this, that the German people will heal themselves again from the inside out. The English Consul here even thinks that 10 years from now we will be as high as before the war! Perhaps I am too tired at the moment to share in such a flight of fancy, and I believe that we will only by a <em>gratia externa</em> [Latin: external grace], like further dissention within the Alliance, catch ourselves up again like a plummeting pilot. For our eastern and southern neighbors, especially for Vienna, Salzburg and Innsbruck, one is reckoning on a Räterepublik in the first weeks of March, and just as for our neighbors, this is a fateful hour also for us. Really in Hungary the reverse development is proceeding under better stars, because there the contrasts remained ever sharper apart and the rightwing parties concluded no coalition and thus had white flags for the new order.

<p>Religious events like Catholic Congresses and popular missions are having unexpectedly great success, but the terrorism of the parties, the low-as-dogs press full of lies and deception for the people, and the senile ungraciousness of the Government trample everything down. From America comes now cash and clothing and food, but what is that for so many? For March I wanted to make a speaking tour in North America and thus collect for our poor, but the endless political tension still holds me back, because I want to remain at my post in times of unrest. Endless constitution conferences, long memoranda, and yet we are coming to no Concordat, because the Government in Bavaria simply interrupts at every principled difference. How long the nerves will still hold out there, I don’t know.

<p>Pardon, Your Royal Highness, these Bavarian lamentations. As I myself ask for prayer, I also promise for the intentions of Your Royal Highness a faithful prayer at the mass.

<p>The terrors of Bolshevism in Russia have, according to the testimony of Prince Trubetskoy, called forth a new religious wave.  In 1918 a great religious gathering was held in Moscow, which, despite the life-threatening dangers felt by participants, experienced an unprecedented number in attendance.  In this great gathering of people from various classes of society, one could no longer find any distinction of class.  “Everyone was prepared to give up his life for Russia.”  The reorganized church fought with all its might against lawlessness.  The Patriarchate was reinstituted and Tichon was elected Patriarch.  Tichon is fully and completely up to the task.  While priests were being murdered everywhere, he hurled an anathema against the government and ordered it to be read in all the churches.  Many priests were punished for reading the anathema, which excommunicated the government, that is, debarred it from the churches and condemned it, but no one dared to take action against the Patriarch.  On the first anniversary of the Bolsheviks coming to power, Tichon sent a letter to Lenin, in which every phrase contained a strong reproach.  The Bolsheviks arrested Patriarch Tichon for this, but nevertheless let him go free again.  They feared the antagonism of the masses.</blockquote><br>

<p>Your Excellency points out to me then the most important matters for consultation in the consultation conference. The issues totally correspond to the time we are in. Indeed I feel that the three main issues place upon us a great responsibility. I feel this all the more since with all three issues we do not know the intentions of our adversaries. But I have no doubt that the consultation conference, which surely has more material than I at its disposal, will do the right thing as to all of this. I can only just say that I really do not believe the Cabinet Ministry will give the Church her walking papers before the elections. I believe the Ministry would thereby be giving itself its own walking papers. And if the Reverend Lord Nuncio would like to know the view of the Bishops on the 19 points,  I can only say that the points correspond thoroughly with the strict Canonical standpoint and I would like to hope that they really would be established by way of the Concordat. But I fear that this hope will not be fulfilled.  To say more will only be possible once the governmental counter-proposals are made known...</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is only now that this Nunciature has received the esteemed Dispatch from Your Most Reverend Eminence No. B-2435 dated Feb. 14 of this year, in which Your Eminence orders a denial of an assertion attributed to Deputy Dr. Heim, according to which the Holy See had shown its preference for the secession of Bavaria from the German Reich.

<p>Since Your Eminence, in the same aforesaid Dispatch, orders likewise that the profound impression that the declaration made upon the lower clergy of Bavaria be corrected in the best way possible, and since - as is known to me - the mentioned statement has also provoked a similar impression in political circles, I have deemed it opportune to have published in the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>, using the same language from the cited Dispatch, without alluding moreover to Dr. Heim’s assertion, the following notice in the form of a telegram addressed to a newspaper in Rome: “It has been recently denied that the Holy See has indicated its preference for the secession of Bavaria from the German Reich.  The Vatican, which, as a constant principle, stays remote from all purely political questions, also in this case has not made any statement to the effect indicated.”

<p>The newspaper preceded the notice with these words: “We have received from a competent source the following news,” which was done without my authorization.

<p>While I now have the honor to append here the German text of the Note in question, which has also been republished in other newspapers, I humbly bow ... etc.

<blockquote>“The Jews Are the Principal Factors of Worldwide Bolshevism: Note established by the official American Services”

   <p>Are the Jews the authors of the Russian Revolution and Bolshevik horrors?  The Jews – dreaming of dictating their will to all governments, thanks to the power of gold – do they have an interest in the red wave breaking upon all Europe and even upon the whole world?

   <p>International Jewish high finance, if it is not the inspirer, has it not seized as its own “the pre-war plan” for Russia that we reproduce above?  Didn’t it use Bolshevism to make the Czarist regime, which was hostile to Judaism, disappear, to annihilate Russian industry and commerce, and make off with the gold and precious objects, the property of the Russian aristocracy and middle class ( Footnote 1: In support of this assertion one could cite the following lines from Prizyf [The Call], a Russian journal edited in Berlin (11/24 Feb. 1920), that we just received as we were correcting the page proofs of the text above:  “Our special correspondent in Switzerland alerted us to the arrival in Lausanne of a group of Jews from Paris.  They entered into relations with the Russian emigrés and began to buy properties and woods in Russia, in this Soviet Russia where we, Russians, have not entered.  These businessmen, without the slightest doubt, have excellent acquaintances there and possess serious information, because if they were not assured of success in their enterprise, they would not conduct it in this way, from afar, in such major business deals.  For a long time it has been confirmed that there exists an elaborate plan, down to the minutest details, whose purpose has been to organize the future destiny of our country.  Thus, from a great number of facts, one can conclude that this plan is being executed with the exactitude of a mathematical formula.  They have taken away the land from its owners, under the pretext that the peasants did not possess enough: a revolting illegality, because this was nothing but legalized theft.  But we do not even know if the peasants have gained any profit from this pillage: the extent of uncultivated and unplanted land is increasing in a frightful proportion.  Aren’t we going to see a large number of grand proprietors appear from among the race of Israel, as has been happening for a long time in Galicia?  The Russian Revolution had the result of placing in the hands of the Jews all the gold of the Russian capitalists:  will the riches of the earth experience the same fate?”) [end of footnote] and thus open to Germany marvelous markets for its products and allow it to assure to itself the friendship of Russia while appearing to save it from misery?

   <p>The “pogroms” of Russia, finally, are they the result of a conscious hatred on the part of antisemites, or doesn’t one have to see there the reaction of peasants against the tyranny of pitiless usurers?

   <p>These are themes of ardent polemics, in which the pros and cons are thrown about with the same apparent conviction.

   <p>It seems to us helpful to read into the record, concerning these troubling questions, the unedited document that you are about to read.  The authenticity of this piece is guaranteed to us; as to the exactitude of the information that it contains, it is such that we can only leave it to the responsibility of the official bureau that authored this note, and we are happy that a public discussion may shed some light on these sanguinary shadows.

<p> “God has given us, his chosen people, the power to spread; and what seems to everyone to be our weakness has been our strength, and has now carried us to the threshold of worldwide domination.  There is little that remains to be built on these foundations.”  (Secret Protocol no. XI of Zion, 1897.)

<p>I. – In February 1916, it was learned for the first time that a revolution was being fomented in Russia.  It was discovered that the following persons and firms had been engaged in this destructive work.
<p>1 – Jacob Schiff . . . . . Jew
<p>2 – Kuhn Loeb and Company . . . . Jewish Firm
    <blockquote>Directors:  Jacob Schiff . . Jew
    <p>Felix Warburg . . . . . . . . . Jew
    <p>Otto Kahn . . . . . . . . . . . . Jew
    <p>Mortimer L. Schiff . . . . . Jew
    <p>Jerome I. Hanauer . . . . . .Jew</blockquote>
<p>3 – Guggenheim . .  .  . . Jew
<p>4 – Max Breitung . . . . . Jew

   <p>There is thus hardly any doubt that the Russian Revolution, which broke out one year after the above information, was launched and fomented by distinctively Jewish influences.

   <p>Indeed, in April 1917, Jacob Schiff made a public declaration that it was thanks to his financial support that the Russian Revolution succeeded.

   <p>II. – In the spring of 1917, Jacob Schiff began to finance Trotsky (Jew) to conduct a social revolution in Russia; the New York newspaper <em>Forward</em>, a Jewish Bolshevik daily gazette, put forth its contribution as well towards the same goal.

   <p>At the same time, in Stockholm, a Jew, Max Warburg, was financing Trotsky and Company, a Jewish firm; this Society was likewise financed by the Westphalian Rhine Syndicate, an important Jewish business firm, as well as by another Jew, Olaf Aschberg, of the “Nya Banken” in Stockholm, and also by Givotovsky, a Jew whose daughter married Trotsky.  Thus were established the relationships between the Jewish multimillionaires and the proletarian Jews.

   <p>III. – In October 1917, the social revolution [<em>revolution sociale</em>] took place in Russia, thanks to which certain Soviet organizations took control of the Russian people.  In these Soviet councils, the following individuals made themselves prominent:</p>

   <p>IV. – At the same time, a Jew, Paul Warburg, formerly involved with the “Federal Reserve Board,” became noticeable for his active relationships with certain Bolshevik personalities in the United States, which, together with other information, led to the blocking of his re-election to the aforesaid Board.

  <p> V. – Among the intimate friends of Jacob Schiff, there is a rabbi, Judah Magnes, a totally intimate friend and devoted agent of Schiff.  The rabbi Magnes is a vigorous protagonist of international Judaism, and a Jew named Jacob Billikopf stated one day that Magnes was a prophet.  At the beginning of 1917, the so-called Jewish prophet launched the first truly Bolshevik association in that country under the name “Council of the People.”  The danger of this association only appeared later.  On October 24, 1918, Judah Magnes publicly declared that he was a “Bolshevik” and was in complete accord with their doctrine and their ideals.

   <p>This declaration was made by Magnes at a meeting of the American Jewish Committee in New York.  Jacob Schiff condemned the ideas of Judah Magnes, and he himself, in order to fool public opinion, left the American Jewish Committee.  Meanwhile Schiff and Magnes remained in perfect harmony as members of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Kehillah.

   <p>VI. – Judah Magnes, financed by Jacob Schiff, is, moreover, in intimate relationship with the worldwide Zionist organization “Poale,” of which he is in fact the director.  His ultimate goal is to establish the international supremacy of the Jewish workers party.  There again is established the link between multi-millionaire Jews and proletarian Jews.

   <p>VII. – Several weeks ago, the social revolution broke out in Germany; automatically, a Jewess, Rosa Luxemburg, took over political control, and one of the principal leaders of the international Bolshevik movement is a Jew, M. Haase.  At this moment, the social revolution in Germany is developing according to the same Jewish directives as the social revolution in Russia.

  <p>VIII. – If we notice the fact that the Jewish firm Kuhn Loeb and Company is in a relationship with the Westphalian Rhine Syndicate, a Jewish firm from Germany, and Lazare Freres, a Jewish house in Paris, and also the house of the Bank Gunsburg, a Jewish house in Petersburg, Tokyo and Paris; if we notice additionally that the above Jewish business concerns are in close relationship with the Jewish house Speyer and Company in London, New York and Frankfurt-on-Main, as well as with “Nya Banken,” a Bolshevik Jewish business firm in Stockholm, it will be seen that the Bolshevik movement, in itself, is in a certain way of speaking a generally Jewish movement and that certain Jewish banking houses have an interest in the organization of this movement.

   <p>The Allies gained a marvelous victory over German militarism.  From the ashes of German autocracy is arising a new worldwide autocracy – Jewish imperialism, whose ultimate goal is the establishment of Jewish domination over the world.

   <p>Even though the Jews, during all the war, did nothing to fill the ranks of soldiers in the different countries, they still obtained the formal recognition of a Jewish State in Palestine.  The Jews have equally succeeded in forming a Jewish Republic in Germany and in Austria-Hungary; these are the first steps toward the future worldwide domination by the Jews, but this is not their last effort.

   <p>International Jewry feverishly gathers its strength, spreading its poisonous doctrines, realizing enormous sums of money (a few weeks ago they realized almost instantaneously in the United States a billion dollars, ostensibly to establish schools and chorales in Palestine and expended enormous sums for their propaganda).
 
  <p>Christianity remains silent, inactive, passive and inert.  Who among Christian men of state will dare to hear the prophetic words of international Judaism?  Who among them has ever taken account that the Jews think exactly what they say, and here is what they say:

<blockquote>“We must force the Goy Government to support by its action the vast plan that we have conceived and which now approaches its triumphal goal, probably thanks to public opinion, which we have secretly organized to help what is called ‘the Royal Secret’ of the press, which, apart from a few negligible exceptions, is already in our hands.  In short, to sum up our system of subverting the Goy Government in Europe, we will show our power to some among them by assassination and terror, and if they think it possible to resist us, we will make them reply to the American, Chinese or Japanese cannons.”  Secret Protocols of Zion, no. VIII, 1897.)</blockquote>

More than ever before it is most essential that love of neighbor be awakened and enkindled in every heart, so that, with the complete extirpation of hatred among peoples, simultaneously with the Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus, auspicious and lasting peace is created.”  Thus wrote Pope Benedict XV recently once again, namely to the association of American students in Freiburg, Switzerland.  Finally, louder and louder voices are also being raised by Catholic elements in hostile foreign lands, against the Paris peace treaty, which the Holy Father on high has implicitly condemned. Today it is the <em>Catholic Times</em>, under the title, “So That We Do Not Forget” the mendacity of that stigma, in that the representative of the Holy See was excluded from the peace conference ... and “negotiations,” in that during the negotiations he had a pistol put to his chest... May this knowledge ever more open a path, because without it a lasting re-establishment of international relations among Catholics is not thinkable; a secure foundation would be lacking. The “liberated” Slovaks have turned in a perplexed outcry to Cardinal Amette, that he might bring their frightful fate to the attention of the Supreme Council.  The memorandum shows the ruthless culture war waged by the Czech powers that be, “who defame our Church, persecute our priests, while the anti-Church societies go about to destroy our youth.  The clergy who are faithful to Rome are subjected to efforts to force them into the schismatic Jednota priests’ association.  Every means is employed to rob us of our pastors, in order to make us all the easier to make into work-slaves in the Czech mines and work-cattle for their factories.

<p>Highly esteemed Herr Baron!

<p>With most devoted thanks I confirm the receipt of your treasured letters of February 22nd and March 1st and the issue of <em>L’Osservatore</em>, after sending which, Your Excellency surely received the Pastoral Letter in several issues.

<p>For competent authorities’ most important understanding of the danger to the continuation of the Nunciature by elimination of the Bavarian Legation, I immediately informed Herr Privy Councilor Held, not without indicating the seriousness of the hour and the responsibility before the forum of history. Likewise I mobilized several gentlemen to keep the food deliveries to the Nunciature from April 1st onward as previously, and Herr Privy Councilor Held assures me that this will be achieved without much effort. The ukase in this matter, which seeks to put the Papal Nuncio on short rations, is once again characteristic of the high line of statesmanship of the Bavarian Government.

<p>The calling away of that personality so highly esteemed by us, Archbishop Pacelli, would be most regrettable in general and especially with the current negotiations. Excellency Pacelli is not merely respected by the Bavarian Bishops, but admired – I have never heard a different opinion – and has won powerful respect from the governmental authorities. Certainly none of the previous Nuncios in Munich ever had so great a burden of work to master and certainly none of them became as thoroughly knowledgeable as Archbishop Pacelli in every single issue of principle. A change at the current moment would not only delay the recently started negotiations on the ordering of Church-State relations, but would also rob the ecclesiastical side of its most respected law specialist.

<p>I am exceptionally grateful to know that Your Excellency expressed these points of view to the highest authorities as also my viewpoint.  I nevertheless do not venture to hold a vote of the Bavarian Bishops because, as I have already repeatedly heard, the Bishops believe they have to adopt the greatest reserve in issues of Papal competence and especially in the personal issue of the Nunciature. Finally for the reason that the Bishops, under the innumerable demands of the diocesan church buiildings, did not bring to pass the erection of a worthy Nunciature building and now face with doubled concern this issue with a deeply felt duty-bound honor. I will make a report of this to the Lord Bishops, since I must soon must send a circular letter to them on account of the Reich school conference.

<blockquote>Re: Counter-Revolution in Germany

<p>With the following information, acquired from good sources, I have the honor to complete the summary reports about the counter-revolution in Germany, sent to Your Most Reverend Eminence by Cable Nos. 346, 347, 350.

<p>The Berlin Government had already had ...

<p>Director Kapp had a general staff composed of Captain Pabst and Publicists Grabowski and Schnitzler, all from the extreme wing of the Conservative Party.
<p>Monarchical elements had infiltrated the conspiratorial spirit in a part of the Reich Army (Reichswehr), especially among the troops returning from the Baltic area that were in Döberitz and the Marine Brigade of General Ehrhard, ...
 
<p>The apparent ultimate goal of all this movement was to overthrow the Ebert-Bauer Government. Friday March 12th in the afternoon it became known that the aforesaid troops – from 5 to 6 thousand men – were marching toward Berlin. While the Government believed itself the master of the situation as a result of the preparations it had taken, in the evening hours things changed, becoming ever more threatening. Some Generals were then sent to parley with the troops on the march. They returned, bringing an “Ultimatum” from these troops containing 7 conditions, among them the dismissal of several Ministers of the Bauer Cabinet and their replacement by technical Ministers. The Ebert Government rejected the ultimatum. On the other hand, to avoid bloodshed, it ordered a retreat by the troops mustered in its defense. It is said, however, that these soldiers had declared they were ready to defend against any attack by the left, but would not have fired in another case against their comrades. It was then that the Ebert Government, without abdicated power, left Berlin and, as has become known, took refuge in Dresden.

<p>During the night of the 12th to the 13th, the counter-revolutionary troops entered Berlin and, not having found opposition, occupied the government buildings.

<p>Director Kapp took possession of the Reich Chancellery and immediately appointed the Minister of the Army, General von Lüttwitz, and other personalities of his party to various Ministries, communicating to the population the fall of the Ebert Government and the taking possession by the mentioned Ministers of their respective offices. Moreover, in a second proclamation, Kapp announced the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag, and in a third, the dissolution of the National Assembly and the new Elections, in order to re-establish order.

<p>To the easy success of the counter-revolutionary movement, the Ebert Government ensconced in Dresden, as I have said, replied with a proclamation, in which it declared itself the only Constitutional Government and exhorted the individual States not to recognize the so-called new Government and to remain in official relations only with the one in Dresden. Moreover a convening of the National Assembly was announced for the 17th in Stoccarda, where the Ebert Government went on the afternoon of the 14th.

<p>Democracy in all its colors: white for constitutional, red for Socialist and black for the Independent Party, responded to Kapp’s attempt with the general strike that moreover was proclaimed by Chancellor Bauer himself at the moment of leaving Berlin. 

<p>The “Center Party,” meeting on March 13th in Berlin with Trimborn presiding, approved the following order of the day: “The Center Party, as a Christian people’s party, remains unshakably upon the basis of the Constitution. It therefore strongly condemns the attempt to overthrow the constitutional Government. The dissolution of the German National Assembly and the Prussian Landtag are an act of violence. It will not be recognized by us. It is treason against the German people to disturb the obvious beginning of the restoration of the fatherland and provoke in Germany the danger of civil war. We are persuaded that in condemning the counter-revolutionary movement we find ourselves in full agreement with our Party’s friends and with the majority of the German people.”

<p>That is how things stand up to now. It remains to be seen what will be the result of this great and dangerous struggle between German democracy and  what they call the Reaction. What is actually hiding under this name of Reaction is not easy to say. Kapp stated explicitly that he does not in fact want a monarchical restoration or a military dictatorship; but what he truly wants to attain by having overthrown or attempted to overthrow the Ebert Government, if not those, is not entirely clear. His political origin, his activities in public life, the persons with whom he has surrounded himself, have given public opinion full reason to judge his action as a reactionary attempt, a rebirth of militarism, a proper and true Counter-Revolution, which if it is not declaring itself at this moment openly as a monarchical restoration, is undoubtedly a preparation for one.

<p>In another Report I will carry out my duty to inform Your Eminence about the other developments of the crisis and about the resolution they will have. Meanwhile humbly bowing ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Further to my respectful report no. 16123 dated March 15th, I have the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence concerning the development and ending of the counter-revolutionary movement that occurred in the past days in Germany.

<p>It has not been easy, especially from afar, to follow the course of events. A jumble of contradictory reports has broken out in recent days throughout Germany. As soon as the Kapp Government had a report published, immediately the Ebert Government rushed to deny it. Thus, Kapp announced that the Entente had recognized him, and Ebert declared that to be false; Kapp made it known that the former Government was engaged in negotiations for a compromise; Ebert published that this was not true. And the examples could be multiplied, since it was rather difficult to be certain- which of the two sources of information was the true one.

<p>It seems to me not useful to expound to Your Eminence the various phases, some of them indeed tragic (in various conflicts between the troops and the proletariat in Berlin and in other cities of Germany there were deaths and injuries) through which this violent struggle has passed between militarism and German democracy. I will rather limit myself to reporting on the latest events that have brought about a solution of the crisis in favor of the Ebert-Bauer Government. In the afternoon of Tuesday, March 16th there was a meeting in the Reichstag building of the Undersecretaries of State who had remained in Berlin, together with members of the Reich Council (Reichsrat). Present from the new Government were Generals von Lüttwitz, von Klewitz and von Hülsen. The Undersecretaries explained to the aforesaid Generals the gravity of the situation and called their attention to the proximate threatening catastrophe. General von Lüttwitz from the outset refused any type of agreement, while Kapp’s people had been informed that he believed he had already lost his situation, and Generals von Klewitz and von Hülsen, who had been against the march of the Baltic troops into Berlin and had declared themselves ready to repel these troops by armed force, these two generals said they were ready for an accord. Later these two Generals brought the news that their colleague von Lüttwitz had resigned.

<p>While these events were occurring in the Reichstag, deputies of the Independent [Socialist] Party, Cohn and Däumig, presented themselves in the Chancellery palace as Heads of the Councils Republic, which they proclaimed. The two were bearers of an Ultimatum: if by 9 o’clock in the evening the troops were not withdrawn from the workers’ neighborhoods, the proletariat would mount an assault on them by force.

<p>As a result of these events, Kapp, as Lüttwitz had already done, capitulated unconditionally.

<p>Vice Chancellor Schiffer had control of the Civil Government; General von Seeckt had command of the troops. Both as representatives of the Ebert-Bauer Government.

<p>Thus ended this episode in the still chaotic life that agitates Germany as the result of a lost war and a revolution that has shaken all its traditions and its systems. This turn to militarism has lost. Perhaps more than proletarian agitations, more than democratic sensibilities and Communist threats, the defeat is due to a tactical mistake. As I have been assured, the counter-revolutionary coup was supposed to be launched two months from now. Moving it up in time could probably be the true or primary cause of the defeat. Will the militarists, after the defeat inflicted by foreign enemies, endure another one by domestic enemies without thinking of taking their revenge at a more propitious moment and with more adequate preparation? That is doubtful. Another consequence, in my humble judgment, deserves to be considered concerning the events of these days. If the Ebert-Bauer Government could win the victory in the grave conflict against militarism, this was due in non-negligible part to the behavior of the Center Party and that of the Catholics. As I reported to Your Eminence in my report no. 16123, the Center Party, as soon as the counter-revolution broke out, published a strong declaration condemning Kapp’s gesture and openly siding with the Ebert Government and the constitution.

<p>Attendant to that, I believe that this act of loyalty and fidelity by the Center Party should be remembered and valued when it comes to negotiations with the Berlin Government to establish legal relations with the Holy See.

<p>I have already taken a step in this sense with the Chargé d’Affaires of Prussia, insisting in a particular way that the extremely serious question of the schools be resolved according to the just desires and sacred rights of the Catholics.

<blockquote>Re: The Counter-Revolution in Germany and the Government crisis in Bavaria

<p>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>As soon as the first news arrived in Munich of the Counter-Revolution attempted in Berlin by Director Kapp with momentary success, as I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful Report No. 16123 of March 15th, the Capital of Bavaria was seized by great commotion, which extended immediately throughout the State. 

<p>The Government, in an emergency meeting (cable 346), published a proclamation signed by all the Ministers, by the Commanding General of the Armed Forces, by the President of the Landtag and by Representatives of the various political parties, except for the Independents. In this proclamation the attempted counter-revolution in Berlin was energetically stigmatized and it was affirmed that the Bavarian people with the Government remain unshakable upon the basis of the Constitution, and that therefore there was no reason whatsoever to go on strike in Bavaria also.

<p>But later the situation got worse. A meeting of Officials on the evening of the 13th pronounced itself for a military dictatorship. In the late hours of the night another council of Ministers convened, which lasted until 4:30 in the morning. The Commanding General of the troops, von Möhl, declared to the Government that he could not guarantee the good behavior of all the soldiers. Then the Council of Ministers handed over to the General himself a mandate as Commissar with full powers, de facto if not formally. Upon his request, a Civil Commissar was also appointed in the person of the Governing President of Upper Bavaria, Dr. Kahr. Only Minister Hoffmann opposed this handing over of power to the Military Authorities. Meanwhile, however, the fact of the appointment of General von Möhl greatly aroused the spirit of the Socialist Party, which, whether as a protest against the events in Berlin, or in opposition to the Military Authorities, which were the locus of practically all power, immediately ordered a general strike (Cable 348), which on the day of the 16th extended to the public services of electricity, gas and water (Cable 351).

<p>The city presented a sad and gloomy sight. Life there was completely suspended. A few automobiles went through the streets.  A few wagons were drawn heavily by skeletal starving nags. Shops were almost all closed. In the main plazas only were seen gatherings of mostly workers of a hardly reassuring appearance. They assembled around extemporaneous orators. There was no visible great show of force. The armed troops were hidden together with numerous police agents and with the Citizen Guard (Einwohnerwehr) in the public buildings. Every so often detachments of soldiers, or of police and armed citizens, elements of the Guard, went up and down the streets. I myself saw some machinegun installations at the most dangerous points and some armored cars making the rounds as a warning threat. It brought back sad memories of the tragic days of spring last year... [ellipsis in original]

<p>On the evening of the 14th an Official Communiqué made it known that the entire Hoffmann Ministerial Cabinet had resigned; that the Bavarian Landtag would be convened on the morning of the 16th to form a new Ministerial Cabinet; and that meanwhile the Ministers would remain in charge until then, while the Minister of Agriculture, Baron von Freybert, had assumed the office of Minister President (of which he was already the Representative according to the Constitution) and Undersecretary Saenger that of Foreign Affairs and of Education and Cultural Affairs. (Cable 349).

<p>From this Communiqué it appeared clearly that Minister President Hoffmann had not wanted to remain in office even provisionally until the formation of the new Cabinet. In fact, the attitude of the Army (Reichswehr) was so unfavorable to the person of Hoffmann that General von Möhl declared he could not guarantee the safety of the Ministerial Cabinet and of Hoffmann personally. In truth, it is affirmed to me that at least fifty percent of the troops, especially the officers, were for the new Kapp Government and for a Military Dictatorship in Bavaria. Four times, as a deputy in position to know told me in confidence, Munich was at the point of having a military proclamation like that in Berlin. The cabinet ministry crisis having occurred in the meantime, thoughts went immediately to the composition of the new Cabinet. The various delegations in the Landtag met for preliminary discussions. The Socialists declared that they would not assume responsibility to form a Cabinet Ministry. Then the Bavarian People’s Party, as the majority party, had to take on this extremely serious burden. The name of Dr. Heim was proposed, as Head of the Government, but this candidacy was abandoned. Heim was too compromised by his well-known separatist ideas. There could have been a danger from the right and from the left. Then thoughts turned to Dr. von Kahr, who had been President of the Government of Upper Bavaria and who, as I mentioned, was appointed Civil Commissar alongside General von Möhl in recent days. But this name immediately encountered opposition from the Socialists. They judged him compromised and unsafe, precisely because he had accepted the office of Commissar, offering to work together with the hated military. The proposal to opt for Kahr as Minister President being affirmed nonetheless, the Socialists declared they would therefore not want to participate in exercising power, also giving assurances that they would not obstruct the working of the Government.

<p>Kahr’s election, which was then confirmed in the plenary session of the Landtag, meeting on the 16th as had already been scheduled, with a big show of force, was due not only to his eminent personal qualities and the trust he enjoyed in his party, but also to the fact that (as I have been told in a totally reserved and confidential manner) he is one of the principal founders and supporters of the Citizen Guard (Einwohnerwehr) and enjoyed immense prestige among its members, the true and trusted guarantee of the tranquility of Munich, since, as I said, the military, if they are reliable for an assault by the left, are not equally reliable for a defense against an attack of the Kapp variety. As to what concerns the interests of Catholics, everyone is certain that Kahr is very well disposed toward them, even though he is a Protestant. Speaking yesterday in the session of the Bavarian People’s Party, he explicitly stated that he completely shares in their program, especially as to the very serious schools question.

<p>On this question the aforesaid Party has asserted in a clear way and has wanted a completely trustworthy man to direct the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs, who has in fact been selected in the person of the Ministerial Director, Matt. For two months an unremitting war has intensified against Hoffmann, precisely for his schools policy. He, who did not intend to give up his anti-religious program for the schools, had finally realized the unsustainability of his position, and it appears that he had welcomed with satisfaction the occasion now presented him to exit the Government without appearing to give up on the schools policy that is so dear to his heart. The new Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs, Matt, is an excellent Catholic, already proven as to his loyalty to the Church and for his ideas about the schools question and in general about relations between the Church and the State. He was the right arm of the former Minister von Knilling, and has rendered excellent service to the Church in the course of his career in the Cultural Affairs ministry. For now the laws and decrees emanating from Hoffmann about the schools question cannot be repealed, but with him their implementation will be impeded. 

<p>The Democrats having agreed at the last hour to participate in the Government, they had with their party the portfolios of Justice and of Commerce, with the same titles as the preceding Ministerial Cabinet. The Ministry of Agriculture was assigned to a representative of the Farmers’ League (Baurnbund), which had also agreed to participate in exercising power (Cable 352).

<p>The new Ministerial Cabinet was presented to the public with a program summarized in a declaration emanating from the President of the Landtag and which contains four points: 1st) the cessation of the Military Commissar and the return of power conferred upon the civil authorities; 2nd) unshakable loyalty to the Constitutions of the Reich and of Bavaria; 3rd) the firm commitment to combat any violent attempt against the Constitution, whether it comes from the right or the left, punishing the guilty according to the law; 4th) complete freedom of organizing (Koalitionsfreiheit) for employees and workers.

<p>This program found its sanction in the speech delivered yesterday by the new Minister President before the Landtag. It then, together with the news of the fall of the Kapp-Lüttwitz Government (Report 16141), brought about the cessation of the general strike (Cable 353), except for that proclaimed as to newspapers, which still continued still over an issue of typographers’ salaries. 

<p>The hopes of the Bavarian People’s Party rest primarily on the elections that they trusted could be held in May at the latest, despite the opposition of the Socialists who would like to delay them. The current Ministerial Cabinet, as President Kahr himself declared in the above-cited speech, is provisional and will remain in charge only until the new elections to the Landtag, which meanwhile it will be able to prepare with the force that comes naturally from having power in their hands. Certainly, however, the resolution of the unexpected and violent crisis was a well-deserved benefit to the Bavarian People’s Party, which, despite undeniable defects and errors, has from the first days of the Revolution worked tirelessly to conserve and make prevail the Christian ideal in the public life of the nation.

<p>The serious problem that now preoccupies is whether the Socialists will break their promise to make no obstruction to the Kahr Government; and whether the new Ministerial Cabinet will be able to rule under the extremely grave weight of responsibility that the hour presents, especially as concerns the rather desperate issue of food in the State, and the still present danger of a repeat of Communist agitation.

<a name="56"></a><p><strong>March 25, 1920</strong> Schioppa to Gasparri re the Record of the Counter-Revolution in Germany and its Consequences:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The political situation in Germany in the course of this past February could be called completely tranquil.  After the law about Workers’ Councils (Betriebsräte) was debated in the National Assembly and finally approved, it was thought certain that there would be no further agitations by the proletariat. Even an armed attack on the Reichstag was easily put down, though unfortunately with the sacrifice of several victims.

<p>In passing I must say that it is not considered absolutely impossible that new agitations could be experienced toward the end of April and beginning of May, like last year.  The bad potato harvest, especially due to a lack of hands to work in the fields, which left much of it to be lost, the reduction in bread rations, the lack of coal, the phenomenal devaluation and the corresponding incredible rise in prices have produced profound turmoil in economic life.  There are, however, negotiations between America and Germany toward the goal of improving nutrition and procuring raw materials and credit, as there is with Holland; and in general there is hope that the situation can improve.

<p>However, while economic disadvantages are always a good opportunity for left-wing elements and are their battleground for exercising influence upon the masses, the right, on the other hand, is gaining support for the different motive of combatting the Socialist Government.  With the revolution, the right has taken on an extremely grave task, made even more arduous by the devaluation of the Mark and by continuous labor agitations accompanied by strikes.  Now, with the Government’s activities largely failing, it serves as an argument for the parties of the right and they say and write: See, it was better before: there was order and prosperity; the fault is with the republican, revolutionary Government and the Socialists.

<p>In fact the German Nationalist People’s Party (Deutsche Nationalvolkspartei) and the German People’s Party (Deutsche Volkspartei), at the beginning of March, introduced a motion in the National Assembly, in which they declared against the prolongation of the Assembly, which, according to them, was no longer representing the popular will, which had limited the mandate of its elected representatives to the concluding of the peace and the drafting of a Constitution, and for that reason these parties demanded that the Assembly be dissolved and general elections be held in early May.

<p>This motion was debated on the 8th and 9th of this month.  The Government declared that the laws for employee stipends must still be taken up, as well as the budget and the electoral laws ...

<p>... In fact the counter-revolution led by Kapp broke out on the 13th, about which I had the honor of reporting to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful Reports Nos. 16123 and 16141... its most disastrous political consequence is the resurgence of Communism...

<p>Currently the armed activity of Communism is gradually ceasing, but their political agitation continues...

<p>In conclusion, the true enemy of Germany presently is internal.  The Central Government is counting on the south and primarily Bavaria and Württemburg.  If the south of Germany can break the Bolshevik storm, it will be an immense benefit for the entire Reich.  But unfortunately the Bavarian Communists have opened a violent campaign against Minister Kahr, whom they attack as illegal, because they pretend he was imposed by the Military Dictatorship and have even declared to the Munich City Council that they will never recognize his Government and will combat it by all possible means...

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>Although, as I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful Report No. 16150 dated March 19, the Bavarian People’s Party, which is now in power, could not immediately abrogate all the laws, regulations and decrees emanating from Hoffmann concerning school policy, yet it has been striving up to now to mitigate the effects of that insane policy and is also trying to undo some of the provisions that most seriously harm the rights of Catholics relative to the religious instruction of their children.  Yesterday gave us a praiseworthy example. On August 14, 1919, the general session of the Landtag approved the proposal of two Democrat deputies, Buehler and Link, by which it was enacted to add to Article 10 of the Law on Schools the following Paragraph No. 2: “ Until the enactment of a Reich law in conformity with Article 143 of the Reich Constitution, the provisions of the ordinance of August 1, 1919 remain in effect.”  With the enactment of this paragraph by the Landtag, the aforementioned Ordinance of then Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Hoffmann thus had the force of law, and by it was decreed the establishment of the Simultaneous School under certain conditions of place and number of children of various confessions.

<p>Now Deputies of the Bavarian People’s Party, Messrs. Wohlmuth and Held, yesterday presented to the Landtag a proposal, which seeks the abolition of the said Article so that the aforesaid Hoffmann Ordinance about the Simultaneous School will be of no legal effect.

<p>The Democrats declared themselves against the proposal. They maintained that the paragraph in question had emanated from the agreement with the Bavarian People’s Party in the meeting in Bamberg, while the formation of a coalition Ministry was being negotiated last year.

<p>The aforesaid Party, from the mouth of Held, responded that in the aforementioned meeting, it had made it clearly understood that it could not follow and accept the favorable tendency toward the Simultaneous School.

<p>The Socialists also expressed their opposition to the aforesaid proposal, based on the same agreement in Bamberg and accusing the Bavarian People’s Party of acting against the Constitution and creating a dangerous battle in the country.

<p>Deputy Speck, Head of the People’s Party, stated that, according to law, the ordinance of the Simultaneous School can well be changed by a vote of the Landtag without thereby coming into conflict with Article 174 of the Reich Constitution. The Democrats together with the Socialists challenged this legal point.

<p>The proponent, Wohlmuth, said that his Party would not have made opposition to the ordinance concerning the Simultaneous School if in drafting it, account had been taken of the desires of those who have authority over the instruction of children, but instead that ordinance, exclaimed Wohlmuth energetically, is a Ukase of the Soviets-Council Republic.  The Bamberg agreement today no longer has significance, he concluded; and we have the right to change it.

<p>To this statement, the opposition responded with vociferous protests, shouting that in this way no agreements concluded with the People’s Party are worth anything.

<p>To which Deputy Held replied that in Bavaria a new legal order is at hand, something that has not happened up to now in the other German states.

<p>After which, being put to a roll call vote, the Wohlmuth-Held proposal was approved by 68 votes to 60, those against being of the Democrats and the Socialists.

<a name="56ac"></a><p><strong>Apr. 3, 1920</strong> Prince Löwenstein, a prominent Catholic active in the Center Party, explains in the <em>Allgemeine Rundschau</em> that while the Center Party has been rejecting antisemitism, Munich’s experience with the Räterepublik justifies the Catholic nobility of Germany’s call for the elimination of Jewish influence in Germany. Translation of article:

<blockquote>“The Catholic Nobility of Germany and Politics” by Prince Alois von Löwenstein

<p>The Association of Catholic Noble People of Germany has made a significant resolution at is session in Münster on February 24th, about which the <em>Köln. Volkszeitung</em>, in its issue no. 165, reports as follows:

<blockquote>In a heavily attended gathering of the Association of Catholic Noble People of Germany in Münster on February 24, 1920, the political situation came under in-depth discussion. All sides were united that the Catholic nobility, indeed in these new times, wants to and must hold fast to the principles that have been represented by Ketteler, Mallinckrodt, Schorlemer-Aist, Droste-Vischering, Franckenstein, Ballestrem, Galen and Hertling. Complete unity among all participants existed, moreover, that the Catholic nobility, faithful to its tradition, in Church-religious and in national-German interests, can only support such those delegates that obligate themselves:

<p>1. To strive by every means for the re-establishment of the Christian character of public life and the State.

<p>2. To protect the natural sphere of freedom of the individual and of human associations, especially the family, as well as the freedom of the Church, against presumptuous encroachments by the omnipotent state or other elements, and especially to defend the fundamental principal of freedom of education.

<p>3. To recognize the character of society and state as a living organism and made up of fundamentally equally valued members according to the teaching of Leo XIII, and to reject every form of rule by a class.

<p>4. To preserve the federal-state character of the Reich.

<p>5. To cherish the monarchical concept and to strive fundamentally for the re-establishment of the monarchy by legal means.

<p>6. To strive toward the development of economic life according to the principles of Christian solidarity under the rule of social justice; to protect the institution of private property based on natural law and allocate the burden of taxation according to the measure of economic productive capacity, rejecting all forms of abolishing private property and tendencies toward socialization.

<p>7. To cherish a decidedly German-patriotic sense and to protect and preserve the treasure of national honor and dignity as the ultimate and precious inheritance of a great proud past.

<p>8. In practical politics, to place principles of divine law and justice as well as faithfulness to principles, far above the viewpoints of momentary opportunism.

<p>9. To require of delegates complete personal integrity and unselfishness and to appoint persons to government positions solely on the basis of their proven virtues and personal qualifications.

<p>10. To remove so far as possible from the public life of Germany the influence of racially foreign elements as the main carriers of the destructive spirit of exploitation, of corruption, and of striving for labor-free profit.

<p>All delegates, no matter what party they may indeed belong to, who acknowledge these principles, may be assured of the support of the Catholic nobility.</blockquote>

<p>The “K.V.” [Kölnische Volkszeitung] holds some of these program points to be “surely regrettable” and judges the entire undertaking as a public action against the policy of the Center Party delegation in the new Germany. As to this judgment, I can only agree with the second part, with provisos. As a member of the Center Party and previous member of the Center Party delegation in the Reichstag, I believe I am allowed to subscribe to every one of the program points, even though I do not unreservedly consider every word to be well chosen. I might say this at least about Point 1: “Re-establishment of the Christian character of public life.” Did the public life of Germany before the revolution really bear a “Christian character”? Was it a Christian state that conducted the Kulturkampf against the heroic resistance of Mallinckrodt, Schorlemer and other leading lights of the Catholic nobility? Or is it true that the new Germany has made a forceful turn away from all Christianity and the striving, to which Point 1 of the Münster Program gives expression, is to be greeted with joy.

<p>Point 5, in my view, is not at all incompatible with the principles of the members of today’s Center Party delegation – not to mention those of the old Center Party Program. For the Constitution sets up the principle of absolute popular sovereignty, and thereby the people can indeed decide about the form of government. One who has adopted the basis of the Constitution may therefore strive for the re-establishment of the monarchy by legal means. A further remark on Point 10. The Center Party up to now has rejected all antisemitism. The experiences of the past one and a half years, however, will allow, even to the Center Party man, the wish “to remove so far as possible from the public life of Germany the influence of racially foreign elements.” Considered in light of the Munich Soviets-Councils Republic for example, no one – least of all the honorable-German Jew – will be able to judge this as raw antisemitism.

<p>What is regrettable is rather something else as it seems to me: the final passage of the proclamation. Should all delegates, no matter what party they indeed belong to, really find support from the Catholic nobility to the extent they merely acknowledge the Münster principles? This can well mean that any party that acknowledges these principles shall be supported...

<p>But which of our parties could subscribe to the Münster Program without denying their past? In my view, this can only be the Center Party and perhaps the German Nationalist delegation. Perhaps. Will the Old Conservatives acknowledge the teaching of Leo XIII as principles of statecraft? (Point 3). Will they want to develop economic life in accordance with the principles of Christian solidarity? (Point 6)...</blockquote>

<blockquote>... <strong>Communist East-Jewry in Austria,</strong> which represents a great danger to the Austrian Catholic Church, is soon going to bring about further disturbances, especially in Vienna.  The old Army was already thoroughly infected by Jewry.  During the war, not at the front but rather behind the lines, there was nothing to be seen but a swarm of uniformed Jews.  The Revolution set the crown upon these elements.  The German-Austrian ersatz military became a refuge for aggressive enterprising Jews.  The West Hungarian ethnic Jew Julius Deutsch is State Secretary for Military Affairs; his brother Leo is a driving power in the Vienna soldiers’ council. The overall soldiers’ council of Austria is commanded by a Slovak Jew, Frey, who thus is actually the supreme commander of the Austrian military powers.  The Bohemian Jew Braunthal is the all-powerful adjutant of the Jewish State Secretary and at the same time the military-political liaison officer with the German Reich.  The Jew Fischer, former secretary of the comrades, was long-time commander of the Vienna arsenal, until he exchanged that post for a good living during the demobilization of the arsenal. The Austrian military justice chief is the Jew Koller; the supreme auditor in the state office for military affairs is the Jew Lelewer.  The “investigatory commission for violations of duty in wartime” is likewise composed exclusively of Jews.  The press chief in the state office for military affairs is the radical Jew Rager.  The Reich education chief is the Jew Stern. The Jewish merchant Aron Wais is the political fixer in the Vienna provincial commissar’s office. Compared to this, the German officer corps in Austria is given over to misery.  A homeowner in a Vienna suburb on the western line was looking for a butler.  He was advised to turn to the officers association.  He did so.  And the result?  Shattering.

Dulles observed that the role of Jews in Communist leadership positions in Bavaria had changed “pre-war tolerance” into a growing antisemitic movement with several periodicals “whose program is to combat the so-called Jewish danger.”  He commented on “the part played by the Catholic Church in Bavarian politics” and predicted that “the power of the Catholic parties will be increased” in the coming Bavarian <em>Landtag</em> elections.  Finally, he noted the unique position of the Papal Nuncio in Munich:  “The only foreign diplomatic representative at present accredited to the Bavarian Government is the Papal Nuncio.”  In the Bavaria of early 1920, in sum, the terror of Communist revolution was still fresh in people’s minds, a growing movement was agitating against Jews as a present danger, and the Catholic Church was the most influential force, uniquely represented by an accredited diplomat to the Bavarian State Government.  That diplomat, Eugenio Pacelli, was in Rome from mid-February 1920, when his mother died, until April 12, 1920.

<p>Dulles sent his report to Ellis Loring Dresel, American Commissioner in Germany.  As the U.S. had not yet re-established diplomatic relations with Germany, Dresel was the highest ranking U.S. diplomatic representative in the country.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“Jewish Imperialism”

<p>The very respected Paris journal “La Documentation Catholique,” issue no. 57, has published an official American report on the Russian Revolution, whose authenticity is well-attested.  According to this report, the Jews Jacob Schiff and Max Breitung, as well as the “House” of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., “took an interest” in the Revolution early in 1916.  One year later the Czar’s empire collapsed.  The American “observers” knew about it!  Early in 1917 Schiff entered into a partnership with the Jew Trotsky Bronstein.  In a similar way the Jewish millionaires and the Jewish proletariat banded together in Sweden and Germany.  The report names individuals and firms.  The Revolution succeeded.  Jacob Schiff boasted publicly about his instrumental role.  Before people could realize it, the Jews were seated throughout the Soviet councils of the Revolution.   The report counts, for example, thirty leaders with their Russian “noms de guerre” and their Jewish family names, for instance Trotsky = Bronstein, Zinovieff = Apfelbaum, Kameneff = Rosenfeld, Bogdanoff = Silberstein, Maklakowsky = Rosenblum etc.  Among Schiff’s confidantes is a Rabbi Judah Magnes, a prophet of Judaism, and, as his distant friends maintain, one of the first “Bolsheviks” on American soil, and at the same time a leader of white-and-blue Zionism.  The Rabbi’s ideal is Jewish world domination, an ideal that unites Jewish capitalists and communists.  Especially interesting is the report’s establishing that the firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co., for which Jacob Schiff serves as a director, stood and stands in association with the “Westphalia-Rhine Syndicate” in Germany, with Lazare Frères in Paris, with the Gunsburg Bank in Petersburg-Tokyo-Paris, with the firm Speyer & Co. in London-New York-Frankfurt and with the Nya Bank in Stockholm.  All these institutions “take an interest in” Bolshevism! – No wonder that “Documentation Catholique,” which also is familiar with and cites to the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” (German translation available from Beek’s Auf Vorposten Publishing House in Charlottenburg), exclaims: “From the ashes of German autocracy a new world power raises its head, Jewish Imperialism, whose purpose and goal is Jewish world domination.”  The Jews have universally avoided military service in order to finally refashion the Christian peoples of Germany and Austria-Hungary into Jew republics.  That would be the first step toward the future domination of the world.

<p>The Catholic Press Association of Bavaria recently published its annual report for the year 1919. It is interesting and can also be encouraging for the Catholic press of other countries to know the results attained by the meritorious Bavarian Association, which is one of the most important for the Christian education of the people.

<p>In the past year there have been founded 118 new local groups of this Association, so that, adding the 39 created in the first months of 1920, there are at least 640...

<p>For the 618 public libraries for the education of the people and of youth, there was an expenditure of 251,164 Marks, while in 1918 there were expenditures of 130,979.  These libraries contain 440,003 works and loaned 1,451,250 volumes.

<p>The central Association has acquired the printing equipment, offices and property of these newspapers: “Buchloer Anzeigeblatt”; “Tuerckheimer Zeitung”; “Kircheimer Landbote”; “Krumbacher Neueste Nachrichten.” The newspapers “Bayerischer Kurier” and “Muenchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung” are exclusively owned by the same Association, which has also entered into ownership of some of the shares of the “Allgemeine Rundschau.”

<p>And this annual report takes on greater importance and merits even more sincere admiration when one considers the immense impoverishment into which the German people were cast by the loss of the war and the political revolutions, which caused at least as much damage as the military conflict itself to the financial situation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In Remembrance of the Hostages Murdered on April 30, 1919”

<p>By graduate student Karl Brassler

   <p>“Every victim on our side is worth, in God’s eyes, a thousand non-Jews.”  (Protocols of the Elders of Zion, 2nd Session.)

  <p>“How shrewd is the maxim of our old sages, that a great goal can only be attained if one is not fastidious in the choice of means and does not count the victims who will be laid low.  We have never counted those victims who are beastly spawn of the non-Jews...” (Protocols of the Elders of Zion, 15th Session.)

  <p>So you have never counted those victims who are beastly spawn of the non-Jews!  The hundreds of thousands of German victims of the World War, the thousands who fell as victims in the battles of the revolution and the civil wars, the hundreds that Jewish revolution murdered in cold blood.  Your abysmal vulgarity and satanic vileness are unmasked and exposed.  Professions of innocence cannot help you get out of this, because facts, since the outbreak of the revolution that you willed and summoned up, have spoken frightfully and have borne witness against you.

 <p>You are guilty of the deaths and misfortunes of many thousands of people of German blood.  You also have on your conscience the brutal murders of the members of the Thule Society on April 30, 1919.

  <p>This murder is not yet atoned for!

  <p>It is a year since that horrible day.  Infamy weighs upon it. Under the unheard of yoke of a Jewish reign of terror, humanity is disgraced.  What has become of our Munich?  What has become of our Bavaria?  The playground of foreign and “German” Jews!  The graveyard of Germans!  The authorities are still keeping quiet about those who gave money to erect an all-Jewish reign of terror.  But we know who they are.  And we can keep waiting, for our time has not yet come.

  <p>One year ago! ...

  <p>What did Levien say in a speech that he gave in the Munich Kindl Beer Hall on April 28th?

  <p>“No matter if a couple thousand bourgeois get their throats cut!”  In other words:  Ordering the slaughter of Germans!  His words became a terrible reality.

  <p>Levien and Leviné and with them all of Jewry let their Asian lasciviousness and their hellish vileness go to work.  They have to answer for double bloodguilt.  The direct murder of the hostages, and the death of the Germans at the hands of torturers.

  <p>Blind mass of workers!  So do you never want to recognize the truth and turn away from your leaders who are only Jews?  So do you still not want to believe that you will be the next victims of the Jews after us?  Snap out of it!

  <p>Levien, Leviné and Toller, they let premeditated terror go to work, terror that is prescribed by their religious law books for every non-Jew.  And they also found help from the local Israelite religious community.  If it had only answered the questions of the police straightforwardly, the authorities themselves would have had the means to sort out the Jews.  But they, in the religious community, betray none of their co-religionists.  In that way they supported those who summoned up the pogrom on the Germans.  And so the “other” Jews, who shut themselves up in the Jewish Central Association, have until now still not come up with any satisfactory indication, consistent with the truth, that they were not in with these criminals of their race and adherents of their religious community.

  <p>Why did Levien, Leviné and comrades give the order to kill the members of the Thule Society?  Why must only Germans lose their lives, Germans like the various students, like the secretary from the railroad, like the countess, who were poor and powerless?  Why are none of the super-rich Jewish millionaires of Munich arrested, much less condemned to death?

  <p>Central Association, give an answer!

  <p>I give you to the Germans!  They did not reap death because they offended against the spirit of the Soviet Republic, or because they had false stamps in their possession.

  <p>No!  Because they were Germans!  Because they strove against the Jewish predominance, because they were members of the Thule Society!  Because the Jews want to destroy and degrade everything that is alien to their nature and that poses the only effective obstacle to their quest for world domination:  The German!

  <p>That is why Levien authorized the house to house search and the arrest in the rooms of the Thule Society.  

  <p>Central Association, can you give another answer?

  <p>In the same way that in Russia all noble native blood was allowed to flow in streams, that in Hungary everything not Jewish was destroyed with ruthless terror and force, so here in Munich you also wanted to destroy and ruin everything, everything, that carried the German name and through which German blood still flowed.  Munich too was to become a fortress and stronghold, a bulwark of Jewish world domination, of international Jewish profiteering finance.

  <p>Those are the reasons, Hans and Fritz, why you must offer up your precious blood, unless you promptly shake off the Jewish yoke with all your might.

  <p>Germans!  Munichers!  The first anniversary of the hostage murders approaches!  Show up to honor and avenge those whom the Jews murdered.  The hour of atonement will come!  It will no longer hold off.

  <p>Keep calm and steady, and wait for the call !
 
 <p>For on April 30th we want to show that we have not forgotten our murdered blood-brothers.  On that afternoon the Luitpold Gymnasium will be witness to a German oath!</blockquote>

  <p>“Yet with the powers of destiny

  <p>No lasting bond can be woven,

  <p>In fact it did follow fast upon the “Observer,” in the form of a dozen-strong “Crime Squad.”  Before Noon on that same day, Herr von Pöhner sent his minions to us with a ukase whose text we want to immortalize here:

<blockquote>Munich, 29 April 1920

<p>Subject: Prohibition of the “<em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>”

  <p>Pursuant to the Regulations of the Plenary State Cabinet, enactments of 8 April 1919 and 4 November 1919, concerning provisional measures for implementation of Article 43, Section IV of the Reich Constitution, I hereby issue the following

   <p>Decree:

  <p>1. The publication of the “Völkisch Observer” is prohibited through Sunday, the 9th of May.

 <p> 2. The costs of the proceedings shall be borne by the publishers of the “Völkisch Observer.” The amount is not yet calculated.

  <p>Reasons:

  <p>On the 29th of this month an article appeared in the “Völkisch Observer”: “In remembrance of the hostages murdered on April 30, 1919,” by graduate student Karl Brassler.  The article blamed the Jews for the deaths and misfortunes of thousands of people of German blood and the “brutal murder of members of the Thule Society committed on 30 April 1919.”  Then the article said: “These murders have still not been atoned for! ...The authorities are still keeping quiet about those who gave money to erect an all-Jewish reign of terror.  But we know who they are.  And we can keep waiting, for our time has not yet come.  Levien, Leviné and Toller ..., they also received help from the local Israelite religious community.”  And in conclusion: “Even Munich was to be made into a fortress, a stronghold, a bulwark of Jewish world domination, of Jewish world-profiteering-finance.

  <p>“Those are the reasons, Hans and Fritz, why you must offer up your precious blood, unless you immediately shake off the Jewish yoke with all your strength.

  <p>“Germans!  Munichers! The one-year anniversary of the murder of the hostages approaches!  Show up to honor and avenge those whom the Jews murdered.  The hour of atonement will come!  It will no longer hold off.  Keep calm and steady, and wait for the call ! 

  <p>“For on April 30th we want to show that we have not forgotten our murdered blood-brothers.  On that afternoon the Luitpold Gymnasium will be witness to a German oath!”

  <p>These words go far beyond the degree of anti-Jewish agitation carried on by the “Völkisch Observer” already for months, endangering public peace and order.  They contain an unmistakable appeal to violence, to an anti-Jewish pogrom.

  <p>Only because it was taken into consideration that this appeal represented one occasion of a misstep by an especially ardent contributor to the newspaper, and because furthermore the newspaper is being given yet one more opportunity to moderate its heretofore inflammatory tone, did this temporary prohibition appear to be, for the time being, sufficient.

<blockquote>“Not Jew-Hatred but Christian-Defense!”

<p>What position does a Christian take on the Jewish question?  He must take a position.  For the Jewish question is the most burning and decisive, and frankly the most distressing, question of the present time.  It will be the fundamental question of the future and of the end times.  It is not only a national, but also an international problem, a world question that concerns all peoples.  No, more!  Not only a world question of political and economic life, but a worldview question, a question of spiritual warfare.  For at the deepest level it is about an eternal war between earth and heaven, between Christian culture and Jewish imperialism.      

   <p>This is a distressing question!  For we fully recognize that among the Jews are a great number of noble people, true Israelites in whom there is nothing false; yet where is the name or the group, where is the party, where is the protest, by which the spirits can be distinguished?  We would gladly greet them as friends; yet they keep silent.  They reject all our complaints.  They cover their degenerate ones with their power, their money, their press, their names.  So it does not become possible to distinguish Jew from Jew.

   <p>The Jewish question is a distressing question because Christianity is the religion of peace, which is love.  Yes indeed, we Christians and we Catholics know how to forbear, to forgive, to love, even our enemies!  If it should ever come to pogroms against the Jews, we would be the first, in the name of Jesus, whom the Jews crucified, to want to protect them.  Yet with all the love of a St. Paul, the Christian takes on the freedom and courage of a Paul in combatting anti-Christian Jewry.  How this man of God stood up against the Jews in Damascus, in Jerusalem, in Antioch, in the cities of Asia Minor and finally in Rome!  Christ is our model, our leader!  And he called them out:

<p>“You brood of snakes and rats!  How will you escape the judgment of hell?  See, I send you prophets and teachers.  But you will crucify and kill some of them, scourge others in your synagogues and persecute them from town to town, so that all the blood of the righteous that was spilled on the earth will come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachia, whom you murdered between temple and altar.”

   <p>How would Isaiah and Jeremiah be slandered today, what names would they be called, if they came back today?  They would be slandered as “antisemites”!  But we are not antisemites.  We are Christians, German Christians, who love their Fatherland and their Church.  But both are in danger of being reduced to chains by Jewry.  So I say: Not Jew-hatred but Christian-defense!

   <p>The Jewish question is distressing for yet another reason.  For I fear that the rightful resistance of the Catholic people against Jewish oppression could easily be taken as a comradely alliance by elements that are just as hostile to Catholic Christianity as to Jewry.  Why do you so often find that pamphlets and essays directed against the Jews contain equally unrestrained outcries against the Catholic Church, Ultramontanism, and the Jesuits?  Culture war agitation is just waiting to strike whenever the struggle against Jewry is not carried out in a Christian spirit.

   <p>Then must we really fight against Jewry?  Isn’t that against the spirit of the Church?  On the contrary.  However far back we look into the past, we find the Catholic Church in a defensive battle against secret conspiracies of the Jews.  From the beginning, marriages between Jews and Christians were forbidden and declared invalid.  The Council of Constantinople specified that no Jew may be a judge over Christians.  Medieval Saxon law stated:  “A Jew may not stand surety for a Christian.”   It was forbidden to have meals with Jews, and the Church’s own laws protected Christian domestic servants from coming under Jewish masters.  The decrees and laws designed to defend the Christian people against Jewish exploitation were really innumerable.  Thus the Jewish question is nothing new.  At the end of the 15th century it was just as burning an issue as today.  The Frenchman Froissard wrote in 1497:

<p>“Hatred against the Jews is so commonly spread throughout Germany that even the most placid men rage when it comes to discussion of the Jews and their monetary exploitation.  It would not surprise me if a bloody persecution were to break out simultaneously in all areas, as they have already been driven out of several cities.”

   <p>In fact the Jews had already been driven out of Cologne in 1426, out of Saxony in 1432, out of Bavaria in 1450, out of Würzburg in 1453, out of Magdeburg in 1493, out of Württemberg in 1496, and this movement could have led to a powerful social transformation if the emergence of Luther and the Reformation had not shifted the focus.  At the same time, the Jews were banished from Russia, while in France persecutions filled the entire 14th century until finally under Charles VI they were banned from the kingdom in 1394.  On English soil the battle was already pitched in the year 1290.  But the struggle was particularly tenacious and full of twists and turns in Spain, where the national uprising and the struggle for religious liberation against the Moors culminated in an altercation with Jewry.  For these had allied themselves with the Muslim conquerors and threatened throne and altar through secret conspiracies.  For that reason King Ferdinand the Catholic finally executed in 1492 the Edict of Expulsion.  To defend against intrigues by the Jews and Moors who remained, who had let themselves be baptized without any inner change, a special court of inquiry was instituted, that so often-slandered Inquisition.  Superficial writing of history and a corruptible partisan spirit, often led astray by Jewish representations, later made that discharge of self-defense of an oppressed people and defensive measures of national governments into persecutions and pogroms against Jews.  The guilt for the constant distrust and often bitter struggles, however, lay with Jewry itself.  For wherever Jews rise up, where they attain to power, influence and wealth, they prove themselves to be oppressors of peoples and persecutors of Christianity.  For them it is all about the realization of all those illusory hopes for the Kingdom of God, on account of which they rejected and crucified the Savior.  For them the Kingdom of God is really nothing else but the world domination of Israel and its religion.  For the sake of this hope the Jewish people undertook powerful revolutions against the Roman Empire, which finally ended with the complete destruction of their national greatness and the scattering of the Children of Israel throughout the whole world.  The bloody war was followed by secret and open struggle with economic means and weapons of the mind.  The Jews sought first of all to tear apart young Christianity with heresies.  Evidence of that is found in so-called Gnosticism.  At the same time, however, they stepped up at every opportunity to agitate for persecution of Christians.  Jew-hatred was already at work in the court of Emperor Nero and occasioned the first persecution of Christians.   Jew-hatred vengefully built the pyre for the martyr bishop Polycarp.  Jews were the favorites and counselors of the apostate Emperor Julian, who wanted to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem to please them and to defy God.  Jews conspired with the Persians against the Christian Emperor in Constantinople.  In short, wherever a conspiracy is at work against the Christian State, Jews stand at the very least as helpers in the background.  That was so in the past; that is so in the present.  More about this next time!</blockquote>

<p>Note: The article turned around the term “Jew-hatred” and used it to refer to supposed instances of hatred expressed <em>by Jews</em> in Rome and the Roman Empire of the first centuries after Christ.  The article invoked the perspective of the Roman Empire, not Catholic faith, in its peroration against the Jewish world conspiracy:
<blockquote>For them the Kingdom of God is really nothing else but the world domination of Israel and its religion.  For the sake of this hope the Jewish people undertook powerful revolutions against the Roman Empire, which finally ended with the complete destruction of their national greatness and the scattering of the Children of Israel throughout the whole world.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“The Diocesan Synod in Munich of Bavaria” (from our special correspondent).

<p>Dateline Munich, April 2 [sic: content of article indicates it was written in mid-April or later]

<p>Mons. Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich and Freising, held a diocesan synod on April 14th and 15th, inviting professors, chaplains, presidents of societies and members of religious orders.  The Synod opened with a solemn Pontifical Mass and a warm allocution by the Archbishop on the history of the Diocesan Synod and its purpose.  The Archbishop also recalled his recent trip to Rome and emphasized the incessant beneficent activity of the Holy Father in these times of uprisings and revolutions.  Diplomats of other nations, he said, have to alter course in their ideas; pontifical diplomacy has remained the same.  We cannot sufficiently thank Divine Providence, he continued, for having given us a Benedict XV and a Cardinal Gasparri; we must be grateful to the Holy Father for sending us a prudent and hard-working Nuncio.  He also took notice of how opportune the clear and wise Code of Canon Law was, while in civil states, by contrast, there reigns disorder and disrespect of the law and all authority.

<p>Moreover, the Archbishop warned that the Synod should not be affected by the modern democratic spirit, but should be penetrated by the mind of the Church, which should animate all the current pressing issues of dioceses and persons, and should recommit to the principle of discipline, and reaffirm the principle of mutual cooperation between the Bishop and the priests.  Consequently, the Archbishop established the office of the Secretariat and entrusted the Vicar General to direct its work...

<p>The reports ended with some concluding words by the Archbishop... he exhorted all the priests to remain united to their Bishops and, with them and all the faithful, to the Holy Father in Rome.

<p>Same page: “An International Catholic Social Review” – from our special correspondent, Munich 

<p>As soon as the World War ended, there appeared repeated and incessant attempts to create a Catholic International.

<p>It was at the First International Congress of Christian workers in Luzerne, in the spring of 1919, that some Catholic sociologists pushed the idea of a Catholic Social International and proposed to assemble a Congress for that purpose.  Before the proposed Congress could take place, however, and precisely at Easter this year, the leaders of the Italian Popular People’s Party took concrete steps to prepare an International that would include all Catholic parties of the various nations, in opposition to the Red, Socialist and Masonic Internationals.

<p>The Catholic workers of the entire world already have a common base in the principles of their faith and their Church, and in the social teaching instilling these principles, so that it would be easy for them to agree among themselves, enter into an accord, and meet in a White International.

<p>To facilitate this union and the foundation of the desired Catholic International, now appears the “Soziale Revue,” published by the Social House of Leo XIII (Leo House) of Munich, Bavaria, which our newspaper recently covered.  The Review itself is not new.  It is celebrating its 20th anniversary.  It is being transformed, however, in view of its newly expressed purpose, taking up the role of the Catholic International Social periodical, entitled in German “Soziale Revue” and edited by A. Retzbach, Dr. of Theology, and Msgr. E. Walterbach.

<p>Thus the purpose of the Review is to interest German Catholics in the idea of the International, to educate them for the realization of this idea, to make them aware of the social work of Catholics throughout the world, their culture, their public life, and their organizations.  Equally the Review proposes to make Catholics in other Nations aware of the affairs of Catholic Germany, its social studies, its organizations, and its public life.  In sum, a fuller and more complete reciprocal awareness of the international Catholic social movement: this is the concise summary of the new Review.
<p>In addition to articles by knowledgeable German authors, it will publish authentic works by foreign contributors about the manifestations and religious struggles of the Catholic world of social teaching and will also welcome unsolicited contributions as well as reviews and newspapers that reprint its materials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The General Assembly of the Catholic Press Association of Bavaria in Munich”

<p>Dateline Munich, April 28 (from our special correspondent)

<p>In the enormous festival room of the Royal Beer Hall [i.e., the <em>Hofbräuhaus</em>], where last year in these same days the turbulent revolutionary assembly of the Councils Republic met tumultuously, the General Assembly of the Catholic Press Association was held on the evening of April 28th.  At least two thousand people were assembled in the immense venue.  They all rose to their feet to applaud enthusiastically when His Excellency Archbishop Pacelli, the Apostolic Nuncio, entered through the doorway, received and accompanied by the President of the Association.  The Pontifical Representative took his seat at the middle of the President’s table and, upn his request, the session opened with the singing of a hymn by an <em>a capella</em> chorus.  Then Count Joseph Arco-Zinneberg, the President of the Association, took the floor, delivering a warm greeting and a touching thanksgiving to the Apostolic Nuncio and similar thanks to all those who are working in the development of the Catholic press.  There followed letters and telegrams and statements of support from clergy and laity. Next was a detailed, encouraging report by the Director, Rev. Dr. Müller, about the state of the finances and the Association’s activities during the past year, of which l’<em>Osservatore Romano</em> has already given a summary in a recent issue.

<p>The Speaker concluded his exposition, frequently interrupted by applause, with opportune words about the obligation that Catholics have to encourage the press that fights for the faith and for the Church, saying there is no need for a good show as to facile criticisms of Catholic newspapers, nor for empty word of more or less sincere praise, but rather a need, even at the cost of sacrifices, to contribute to the development of Catholic propaganda, which is all the more difficult today, when the costs of keeping a newspaper alive are greatly increasing.

<p>After the new Board of Directors of the Association was unanimously elected, Archbishop Pacelli was presented, with utmost acclamation, and he pronounced a felicitous discourse in flawless German, expressing his joy in finding himself again at a meeting of the Catholic press, expounding with lively words the sovereign interest of the Holy Father for the Catholic press in general and for the association that is supported with such approbation in Munich of Bavaria, and, finally, imparting in the August Name of the Supreme Pontiff, the Apostolic Benediction, which was received by the overwhelming number of listeners on their knees, followed by an absolute tempest of applause for the Representative of the Pope.

<p>This was followed by the singing of some other Psalms, and finally Fr. Lang, S.J. delivered a noteworthy speech on the importance of the Catholic press in the present hour, proclaiming “the people’s pulpit in modern times.” This was the title of his lecture: “Völkerkanzel der modernen Zeit.” [German: People’s pulpit in modern times] The learned orator outlined the difficult battles that Catholics must fight in these stormy times, especially in the field of the schools, explaining the particular characteristics that this struggle presents in the free State of the new Bavaria. He proceeded to mention the dangers encountered by modern youth in the form of infamous immoral propaganda that seduces them, appealing to all the basest instincts, by means of newspapers, reviews, novels, theatrical and cinematic presentations, etc., and concluded by demonstrating how one of the most effective means to combat infernal, evil propaganda is the Catholic press. “We must,” he exclaimed amidst the applause of the Assembly, “we must go into the arena fully armed to fight like lions. We owe this obligation to our Holy Catholic Church; we owe it to our children; we owe it to our conscience! Nothing is too much to do for the Catholic press.”

<p>This energetic peroration was accompanied by prolonged acclamation ... </blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Taking of Kiev”

<p>Newspapers report from Paris:

<p>The taking of Kiev by the Poles was officially announced today in Russian dispatches.  There were five days of fighting inside the city.  Militarily Kiev had already been lost for several days given that the strategic points were occupied by the Poles.  Today dispatches from Warsaw announced a further advance and the conquest of new positions toward the Dnieper River.  Also the region around Odessa, it was officially communicated, has been reconquered by the Ukrainians, notwithstanding the lack of any precise news coming from the city as of this moment.  In any event it is apparently considered lost by the Bolshevik troops.  Examining the war dispatches with the aid of a map of the Ukraine, it can be seen that the military actions were launched along three principal lines.  The first, from north to south, conquered the coastal territory between Odessa and Kherson; the second, from west to east, has already gone beyond the city of Kiev; the third, from southwest to southeast, appears to be moving along the Dnieper toward Dnipropetrovsk to make contact with the army of the north.

<p>Along the Dnieper, then, another military decision could occur.  The Polish advance has strongly brought out the national Russian spirit and has certainly weakened the authority of the Soviet Government.  From these two new factors in Russian politics, there could arise, in the not distant future, a situation of great political interest for Eastern Europe.

<blockquote>“Where Stands the Adversary?”
 
<p>At the assembly in Lvov, a young Jewish rabbi cried out:

<p>“The time will come when the Christians will wish to become Jews; but the Jewish people will push them away with contempt.  The main enemy of the Jews is the Catholic Church.  That is why we have planted the spirit of dependency and disunity in this tree.  We are the ones who magnified the conflict and disunity among the Christian denominations.  First of all we will struggle against the Catholic clergy with the greatest determination.  We will smear them with mockery, contempt and scandalous stories about their life, in order to make them despicable to the world.  We will take over the schools.  And the Church will soon lose its influence if it is made to be poor.  Its riches will become the booty of Israel!”
 
  <p>This trumpet call of war from the year 1912 rings in my ear like the shrill battle cry of Lucifer.  Now I know from what source those scandal stories flow, those mocking caricatures and rabble-rousing articles against the Pope, Bishops and Priests, against Catholic institutions and sacraments, and whence the smutty flood of newspapers and magazines.  Everyone knows of course that a great portion of the press is in the hands of the Jews.  I no longer wonder in vain what the origin is of the degradation of our art, the debasement of our fashion, and the undermining of Christian morals.  I know who is hiding behind the film “Vow of Chastity” and whose stage it is where the only plays performed are the likes of “Devil’s Wives” and “Rectory Farce.” The French culture war against the Church was opened by the Jew Gambetta with the slogan, “Clericalism, that’s the enemy.”

<p>How is it in our schools? Of every ten professors in our universities, six are Jews, authentic, baptized, or related. Bewail to God what a frightful battle has been waged from there against our Christian faith, in the name of science; and now the spirit of Christianity is supposed to be driven from the public schools.  There also the Jews are among the leaders.  Hardly had [Ernesto] Nathan ascended the mayoral seat of Rome [in 1907] with the help of the Freemasons, than he went about removing religious instruction from the public schools. We have seen the same and even worse in Austria, Bohemia and Hungary.  What is being planned in Prussia and Germany is known to everyone. The Jew has said: “We will take over the schools.”  Hasn’t he prophesied correctly, if the Church wants to act weak?  “The riches of the Church will be the booty of Israel.” That is what happened in France.  In Germany it will be no different.  And whoever wants to know what Jewish rule would bring us, can open his eyes and look at Hungary and Russia.  Are these not true persecutions of Christians, in light of what has happened there? And who led them?  I’ll name only a few names: Bela Kun, Szamuely, Lenin and Trotsky.

<p>In Budapest an insolent Bolshevik dared to drive his auto into the midst of the Corpus Christi procession and mock the Blessed Sacrament with shameful gestures.  Who can blame the people if they boxed the blasphemer in the ear?  All the signs confirm that we are headed into a new era of persecutions of Christians, and it is Jews who are stoking the fires. But will they have the power to carry out their plans?  Jewry dominates the world.  World finance is Jewish finance.  They dominate commerce, trade, the press, art, politics, the States, the spirits.  They have at their disposal more than two powerful armies, Freemasonry and international Social Democracy.

<p>What then is to be done?  We must immediately liberate ourselves from Jewry and the Jewish spirit, from materialism and worldliness.  We must be completely Christian in thoughts, intentions and conduct.  But then we must break off, by every lawful means, the fetters with which Jewry has bound us.  Shut the gates to immigration from the East!  The countries of the New World keep close watch against foreign immigration, but with us the dam is yielding before the immigration of peoples that oppress us and then force us into migrating.  What must we do?  We must use lawful means to bring down the tyranny that makes us into Jew-slaves.  Christian peoples may not be governed by Jews.  “America for the Americans!  Asia for the Asians!  Africa for the Africans!” resounds today throughout the world.  And “Jerusalem for the Jews!”  Good, so this also applies:  “Germany for the Germans!”  And “Christendom for Christianity!”  What must we do?  We need a new Reformation!  Marx, the founder of Socialism, himself a Jew, says:  “An organization of society that casts out the exploiters, that removes the possibility of exploiters, has been made impossible by the Jews.” Everything must be built anew, all of economic life must be built anew according to Christian concepts, the spirit of profiteering rooted out, the nature of law must once again become German and Christian. And if the enemies are too powerfully many – the Lord says:  “Do not fear, little flock.  For it has pleased the Father to give you the Kingdom!”</blockquote>

<a name="68a"></a><blockquote>“Vatican Review”

<p>In St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome at this moment, preparations are underway for the canonizations and beatifications scheduled for later this month. If it is certainly no small task to decorate a cathedral such as the Church of Our Lady in Munich, for instance, in grand style from top to bottom, imagine what an immense task it is to hang and arrange the decorations so that such an enormous space as St. Peter’s Basilica gives the overall impression of greatness and majesty!  Since two of the new saints are from France, the French element will naturally make an especially strong appearance on this occasion.  The French Government has also been moving quickly to expedite the negotiations with the Vatican so that the new French Ambassador to the Vatican can appear for the first time in this new position.  The motive for this relationship is something we do not wish to analyze.  A very significant reason for France to turn again to Rome was concealed, to be sure, during recent days at San Remo. So, just incidentally, we were made aware that henceforth in Palestine the special protectorate [of France over Christian missions] was eliminated, and consulates of individual nations will only protect their own citizens. This can only be considered as a defeat for France, at the hand of its allies, if one considers what great importance France formerly placed upon this protectorate, how jealously it was guarded, and that it was only a few months ago that France sent Cardinal Dubois to the Holy Land as its envoy, who expressed his firm conviction several weeks ago to the <em>Nouvelliste</em> of Lyon that the Holy See could absolutely do nothing other than renew this special prerogative.  England, moreover, received the “Mandate” over Palestine, that is the “right” to govern and rule there as it pleases. They went even yet a step further in San Remo and interfered directly with the rights of the Pope.  Namely, they as good as eliminated the Custodianship of the Italian Franciscans [over the Holy Places], which is not a governmental institution, even though political considerations have conceded them a certain role in recent times, and placed them under a Commission to be named, consisting of two Catholics and two schismatics, under a chairman to be appointed by the League of Nations.  It is really the Pope who will yet have the last word in this matter...</blockquote><br>

<p>(General News) 1. The so-called <em>white</em> terror in Hungary. – 2. The Allies and Russia. – 3. The results of the San Remo Conference explained to the French Parliament and the English Parliament.

<p>In journalistic jargon the <em>red</em> terror is that which the <em>reds</em>, that is the socialists, especially the most ardent ones, the maximalists, communists and bolsheviks, dream of instituting by their revolutionary power, cruelty and tyranny, once they achieve the mastery of public power.  Russia knows this by long experience; Hungary knew it for a period of time.  But now has been discovered, alongside the red terror, the <em>white</em> terror; and it is attributed by the socialists to Hungary, now ruled no longer by Bela Kun, but by a Christian-Social government.  For some time there have been in the newspapers, in the political assemblies and in the Parliaments, loud complaints against this government for the presumed ferocity of its vendetta and its repressions against the former communists: in sum, a cry of Hungarian <em>white</em> terror, against which the British Labouristas as well, not content with verbal protests, have also made practical proposals.  Now the Hungarian prime minister has thwarted this invention by giving nothing less than an invitation by telegram to the <em>Trade Unions</em> to send a delegation to Hungary and verify with their own eyes the falsity of the rumors that are being circulated.  Then, recently, on the 12th of last month, a Stefani telegram stated that the engineer Mantner and his three accomplices who are accused of conspiracy against the life of the Governor of the Hungarian State, Admiral Horthy, having been condemned to death by hanging, have now received a commutation to life imprisonment at hard labor.  It cannot be said that this is an act of a terrorist.

<p>The truth is that the Jewish-Bolshevik tyranny made such an evil name for itself, that just the memory of it arouses terror in the Hungarians; but this does not mean they want to undo one terror in order to institute another.  The first to disbelieve this are the same socialists who squawk in bad faith; for they know that terror is the privilege, if ever (and previously that of 1793), of revolution and revolutionaries, and not of men of order.

<p><strong>Men and Women Electors!</strong>

<p>On <strong>June 6th</strong> are the general elections to the 

<p><strong>Reichstag and Landtag.’

<p>What does the Reich need?</strong>

<p>The Reich needs:

<blockquote><strong>peace, order and security, rule by justice and law, state authority.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Without these fundamental pillars of all orderly governments, there is no security of body, life and property of citizens, no orderly means of care for food and necessities of daily life, no re-establishment of the people’s economy in our Fatherland.

<p>On June 6th, it is a matter of building an insurmountable dam against the flood of eternal revolutions. This unbreakable dam is

<p><strong>the determined and unbroken will of a powerful majority of the people for the preservation of peace, order and law-abidingness in the state.

<blockquote>The Bavarian People’s Party</blockquote>

<p>has proven itself during difficult times to be the strongest bulwark of state order and economic peace.

<p>Therefore vote into the Reichstag men and women of the Bavarian People’s Party!</strong>

<blockquote>The Reich needs: the enthusiastic joint effort of all:

<p>for the formation and fashioning of the Reich government domestically,

<p>for the re-establishment of its economic strength,

<p>for the restoration of its dignity and respect in the outside world.</blockquote>

<p>This enthusiastic joint effort will not be produced by taking away the time-honored rights of the individual states, by the ignorant suppression of all cultural particularity or by the centralizing of all  power in Berlin, but rather by the one and only way of building the German Reich on a federalistic foundation.

<p>The Weimar Constitution does not correspond to this goal. The Bavarian People’s Party will therefore endeavor, in association with like-minded parties, to amend it by lawful means in a federalistic manner.

<p>The Reich needs: equal political consideration for all major occupational classes. The Bavarian People’s Party therefore tolerates no sort of class domination in the Reich.  It will never allow the worker’s hard-earned rights and liberties to be taken away; on the other hand, it will also not allow the bourgeois and farmers to be trodden down as political pariahs, or white collar workers to fall into distress, impoverishment and contempt.

<p>The Reich needs: the reinvigoration of the nationalist concept and the self-understanding of all Germans of their national dignity.

<p>The Reich needs: the domestic and foreign unity of all Germans, whether they now live within the borders of the old German Reich or outside in the German districts of the former Habsburg monarchy.

<p>This unification if only possible if a domestic and foreign <strong>policy of understanding</strong> is pursued, and only possible if on the basis of such policy the dictated Peace of Versailles is revised.

<p>Both of these, domestic as well as foreign understanding, are the aspiration of the

<blockquote><strong>Bavarian People’s Party.

<p>What does Bavaria need?</strong></blockquote>

<p>Bavaria needs: <strong>a Landtag and a government</strong> that forces with all its strength, in these times of unrest and ferment and governmental disarray, the upholding of state authority and the rule of justice and law.

<p>Therefore vote for the <strong>Bavarian People’s Party,</strong> whose efforts succeeded in the month of March in establishing a strong government of order.

<p>It will under no circumstances give up the sole support of order that is still at our disposal:

<blockquote><strong>Reich Army and Einwohnerwehr!</strong></blockquote>

<p>Bavaria needs: <strong>a Landtag and a government</strong> that fearlessly makes a manly front, supported by the unbending will and trust of the majority of the people, against all 

<blockquote><strong>attempts by Berlin</strong></blockquote>

<p>to trample down the rights of the Bavarian State in the interests of a culture-leveling Socialistic national government and thus suppress the still-remaining element of our independence.

<p>Bavaria needs: 

<blockquote>Upright holding together of all order-loving elements; reciprocal understanding of the individual classes for one another; peaceful, understanding cooperation of employers and employees, bourgeois and farmers, workers, teachers and government employees.</blockquote>

<p>The Bavarian People’s Party will therefore not be a one-sided class party, but rather a true <strong>People’s Party,</strong> in which the interests of all classes will be represented according to the principles of equitable justice.

<p>The political and economical significance of the major professional classes shall find their fulfillment in 

<blockquote><strong>a first chamber for professional classes.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Bavaria needs:

<p><strong>a thrifty Landtag and a thrifty government.</strong>

<p>The Bavarian State shall not fail to satisfy the absolute needs of its officials and governmental employees, its administration, its schools and the churches, but it shall observe everywhere a prevailing thriftiness in the fulfillment of governmental tasks.

<p>Bavaria needs <strong>a Landtag and a government</strong> that have will and power to protect the state energetically from inundation by ethnically foreign, destructive elements from the East, a Landtag and a government that drives out from the people, with most severe emphasis, the spirit of usury and exploitation.

<p>Bavaria needs:

<blockquote><strong>Peace for School and Church.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Kulturkampf is a crime against our Fatherland, a double crime when we are up to our necks in bodily distress.

<p>The Bavarian People’s Party will therefore stand up energetically, true to its principles, <strong>for the religious education of our youth according to the principles of Christianity,</strong> for without such there is no auspicious future for our state, <strong>for the protection of the rights of those who are qualified to teach, for the freedom and independence from all-powerful government for the church of both confesssions,</strong> but it will also be a sincere opportunity for freedom of conscience and consideration of the earnest convictions of others. On the other hand, it will combat known moral well-poisoning with all its power.

<p>In this it counts upon the special cooperation of women.

<p>The woman now has a political voice, and her mission is first of all to make use of the weapon of the voting right in this struggle over the moral foundations of the state.

<p><strong>Therefore, Bavarian women, vote for the Bavarian People’s Party!

<p>Fatherland above party!</strong>

<p>Parties are necessary, however, for the joint effort of the like-minded. A strong, determined government of Reich and state is only possible, however, if there are only a few major parties at hand, which can cast the whole weight of their credibility into the balance for important matters of state.

<p><strong>So vote for the Bavarian People’s Party. It is the strongest guarantee of sound governmental conditions.

<blockquote>“Opponents of the Spirit of Pentecost”
   
<p>The Acts of the Apostles movingly describes how, on Pentecost, the Spirit of brotherhood descended upon the young Christian community and awakened a general joyfulness of self-sacrifice, which led to a selfless sharing of property and a primitive form of socialism.  Among the political parties today that claim to be Christian, we do not find even the slightest trace of a reconciling, active, practical love.  The German National Party, in which Protestant Pastors like Mumm during the war preached bombs-and-handgrenades Christianity, is systematically poisoning our public life by their antisemitic propaganda and are paving the way for pogroms against Jews …

   <p>Antisemitism enjoys the widest promotion in the Bavarian People’s Party.  Here Heim and companions are shoveling with both hands out of the dreary, super-abundant sources of antisemitic smear words.  Here they thunder against the “Berlin Jew-Dwarves,” against the “New Jerusalem on the Spree” [River in Berlin]... 

   <p>In Bavaria, Herr von Kahr has been promoted to Minister President by Heim and his shield-bearers, and he inaugurated his tenure with some words against “racially foreign” elements.  Right under the eyes of the Minister, who before the assembled home defense force made a solemn confession of Christianity, such a shameful anti-Jewish campaign has been organized that finally even the Protector of the German-<em>Völkisch</em>, Herr von Pöhner, had to intervene against the “German-<em>Völkisch</em> Observer,” because this paper had too forcefully and crudely tried to incite pogroms against Jews …
 
  <p>Agitation against Jews has become, for the “Christian” parties of the Right, a political weapon for the overthrow of republican government.  These pious “Christian people” who are trying to buy the souls of the spiritually blinded with the blood money of heavy industry, with the most iniquitous Mammon of the world, have never understood the depths of the Gospel, which called all peoples and all races, through the “miracle of Pentecost,” to a great service of mankind, which was also expressed immediately in the practical socialism of the first Christian community.</blockquote><br>

The Holy Father cannot rescind the decision already made about the transfer of Your Illustrious Excellency to Berlin: but until you receive Credentials, you must remain as Nuncio in Munich. In the meantime, prepare the Bavarian Concordat materials, and immediately after the elections, take up again and quickly bring to a conclusion the negotiations. I would like you to inform the Archbishop of this; it is understood that this Nunciature will not remain vacant for any considerable time; indeed, as Your Excellency departs for Berlin, Munich will see its new Nuncio.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Christianity and Socialism”
   
<p>The only major example in history where a powerful State became socialist was offered to us by the history of the missions in South America.  There the Jesuits, in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries, on the banks of the Parana and Uruguay, founded the so-called Indian Reductions.
   
<p>The Church must place itself on the side of the proletarians.  Then the proletariat will stop seeing the Church as its enemy.
   
<p>Christianity does not claim any sort of power over economic and political life.  It desires only that the economic and political efforts not be in violation of faith and morals.
      
<p>That the State professes to be Christian is a secondary thing [Nebensache], that it acts Christian is the primary thing [Hauptsache]

<p>The German-<em>Völkisch</em> swastika brethren brought a lawyer Dr. Butz into the Wagner Hall on Wednesday to speak about the “Struggle for Germany.”  His statements were almost exclusively in the field of race and language research.  These were grounds on which the discussion of the most hateful antisemitism could be worked out.  An opposite-minded speaker dared to confront the rather youthful swastika men with the unreasonableness of their “anti-Jewish agitation at any price.”  Rude interruptions made it often impossible for the speaker to make himself understood and finally the gathering declared that they did not want to hear this opponent further.  A half dozen German-<em>Völkischers</em> sprang after him onto the podium and led songs.  The antisemitic rage is beginning to get pathological.</blockquote>

We will bring ourselves to the condition of Hungary if we do not finally enlist the bearers of German popular culture for a systematic combatting of violent antisemitism. </blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“Supporters and Friends of the Center Party!”

<p>The German National Assembly is placing its mandate back into the hands of the people.  The German people are being called upon to elect the first Reichstag under the new Constitution.  A momentously fateful hour for people and Reich! It demands above all

<p><blockquote><strong>examination and retrospection.</strong></blockquote>

<p>On February 6, 1919 the German National Assembly came together in Weimar in accordance with the unanimous desire of the entire German people. Without it, and its successful expeditious work, no peace with the outside world would have come to pass, the Reich would have gone down, and civil war would have ground up our last energies.

<p>Such misfortune has been avoided. Already by February 10th, the National Assembly decreed a provisional emergency constitution. In place of revolutionary dictators, a lawful Government stepped forth immediately, a new Reich army arose to defend against violence and insurrection, ruin and disorder were gradually overcome, and the rebuilding of the state and the economy could begin.

<p>This decisively significant new achievement was only possible

<blockquote><strong>on the basis of the Coalition.</strong></blockquote>

<p>A majority formed by the Center Party with the parties of the right was not possible. These parties together had at their disposal only 154 delegates. They were 58 votes less than half the total number of delegates. Even if the 75 members of the Democratic Party are added, the result is just a small numerical majority of the non-Socialist party delegations. But even such a government, without the participation of the Majority Social Democrats, would have been impossible for foreign and domestic reasons. For the re-establishment of order, it required the active, constructive cooperation of the masses of workers in city and country. Only the participation of the 165 members of the Majority Socialist Party could guarantee this cooperation.

<p>It was equally impossible to do without the cooperation of those bourgeois elements that had committed themselves to democracy. A purely Socialist government would have inevitably ended up dependent upon the extreme left. Only those willing to gamble upon complete collapse could have wanted that. For the German economy an irresponsible bet!

<p>A coalition without the Center Party is something that neither the Social Democrats nor the Democrats would have joined. A coalition being necessary for the salvation of Germany, we were forced to participate apart from consideration of our cultural interests. For coalition means concessions, it means reaching agreement upon a middle course. None of the participating parties can implement their own party program in that way. They could only unite upon a common governmental program offering political common ground. Today even broad circles of the right openly admit the indispensability of the coalition.

<p>On February 21st 

<blockquote><strong>the new Reich Constitution</strong></blockquote>

<p>was brought before the National Assembly in outline form, and on July 31st, 1919 it was finalized. What had never been accomplished after any great revolution of modern times, the German National Assembly has completed in five months: a re-invigorating, reformational Constitution for the Reich; a Constitution that to be sure represents a compromise that we must speak against as to details, but which is nonetheless exemplary in its social-minded spirit and valuable in the protections that it guarantees for our moral and religious heritage.

<p>The new Germany could not live by the formal Constitution alone.

<blockquote><strong>It needed peace and the necessary means of existence.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The National Assembly also took care of that. How the Center Party and the Social Democrats were at odds on account of the concluding of the peace treaty! Today these accusations have gone almost totally silent. It is the details of economic and financial rebuilding that are fought over.  By and large the possible and the necessary have happened. If ever, in these times the economic situation has been much stronger than the people involved. Only future generations will fully value the work of the German National Assembly in its full significance, and especially recognize the decisive participation of the Center Party in this work. 

<blockquote><strong>Towards the future</strong></blockquote>

<p>is where the elections direct our attention. The future will demand even more insistently than the past a strong Center Party. What unites its supporters, now as before, is the fellowship in an idea: the idea of a Christian <em>Volksgemeinschaft</em>.

<blockquote><strong>State, Religion and Church</strong></blockquote>

<p>are inseparable. We are well aware that our people will not be helped by governmental measures and laws alone, unless a deep interior renewal takes hold of all members of our people. The overcoming of the materialistic spirit, the reconciliation of classes, the victory over class struggle and class egoism can only be brought about by the spirit of Christianity. Faithful to our past, we therefore stand up for a position of religion and Church in the state that corresponds to their significance. The greatest significance of all, in our assessment, is the new school law to be fashioned by the future Reichstag. Upon its design will depend, first and foremost, the future of schooling in the entire German Reich. We expect that all supporters of the Christian <em>Volksschule</em>, especially the members of the Center Party, will not lose sight of this viewpoint during the elections. It will not fail in the Reichstag delegation of the Center Party.  We will exert our full effort so that the constitutional rights for a Christian school will not be denied to the parents. We will oppose by all means any proposal for school compromise that is disadvantageous to Christian education. Indeed in the future there will be a most dependable joint stand by all religious-minded elements, whatever their confession, to ward off attacks from the anti-religious side upon our Christian worldview.

<p>Also our national communal sentiment must be born from the spirit of Christian charity and social justice, outwardly just as domestically. Thus we hold firmly in foreign policy to the 

<blockquote><strong>ideal of reconciliation among nations.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The Versailles Peace Treaty poses the greatest obstacle to a comprehensive cooperation among civilized Christian peoples. Thus we demand its revision; but not by means of force, rather with the help of a wise, understanding policy. We expect a clear and focused negotiation with the Powers that are ready to give back to Germany its possibility of life. Our most important goal thereby must be to ameliorate the situation of our Germanic brethren in the occupied and cut-off districts. We demand even stronger interest from the Government and a yet greater economic assistance for the occupied districts than previously.

<p>In domestic policy our goals are:

<blockquote><strong>The democratic state.</strong></blockquote>

<p>We acknowledge ourselves to be a Christian people’s state. On the basis of political equality of rights, we demand most active participation of every member of the people in the state. Equal rights and equal duties for everyone! We most sharply condemn every effort to overthrow the Weimar Constitution by force, and we demand unrelenting punishment for all crimes against the Constitution, whether they come from the right or the left. We reject any form of class domination. And for the time after the elections, we demand a strong, capable government. In its formation, all valuable groups of the people that have an earnest will toward the rebuilding of the state upon a constitutional foundation, must be represented. A government of the extremes is something we hold, now as before, to be the greatest misfortune that Germany can meet. It would be its downfall.

<blockquote><strong>The new organization of the Reich.</strong></blockquote>

<p>We hold fast to the newly created fundamentals of a strong Reich, to national systems of taxation, transportation, defense and law. But we reject over-centralized national government. The historic particularity of the individual states and cultures is to be preserved by appropriate allocation of authority. Any predominance by an individual state must be set aside. All states should have their appropriate part as to law and economy. The resolution of these issues should begin immediately.

<blockquote><strong>Administrative Reform.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The new reconstruction of the entire governmental administrative structure must be set in motion as soon as possible. We desire an organic relationship of self-government and governmental unity. The immeasurable growth of the machinery of government must be re-directed by a systematic equity between Reich government and self-government of states and provinces. The most stringent economies in all governmental operations is indispensable.

<blockquote><strong>A reliable army.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The defense of the state and domestic order require an expansive, reliable defense force. We desire the purging and exclusion of all unreliable elements from the Reich army, whether of the rightwing or the left. Therefore we represent the exclusion of politics from the Reich army. In order to be able to fulfill their duties, members of the Reich Army must be in an economically secure position.

<p>The wounded warriors and surviving spouses of the previous army have a right to care and economic support. And this spirit is responsible for the new Reich care law.

<blockquote><strong>The Strengthening of the National Economy.</strong></blockquote>

<p>In the formation of self-governing bodies for the individual sectors of the economy, growing up organically from the will of the participants, we see the foundation for the new ordering of our national economy. We stand for an organic relationship of economics and politics. State interventions in economic life must be restricted to what is necessary and can only succeed by extensive consultation with experts in the respective economic sectors. Therefore we demand expeditious introduction of a final Reich economic council and district economic councils with sensitive consideration of the special economic interests of the individual sectors of the individual states.

<p>We stand for unremitting struggle against the importation of luxury items and trashy goods, and for necessary controls upon imports and exports under extensive consultation with the self-governing bodies of the individual economic sectors.  Luxury consumption by the war profiteering indulgent rabble of our big cities must be relentlessly combatted, and racketeers stopped by all means from their shady operations.

<p>We are and will remain the party of economic and social equity. We tolerate no egoism of class or status. Thus we promote the interests of every group within the framework of the common good. 

<p>German agriculture is and will remain the foundation of our national economy. Thus one of our most important goals is to bring our domestic agricultural production back to its previous levels. We are therefore in favor of the deliberate dismantling of government controls. We demand a price policy that rewards and promotes agricultural production in all districts. Production of fertilizer must be increased by all possible means. Medium and small farms are to be protected and increased in number.

<p>Germany’s industry is just as indispensable for us after the war as before. Upon its operating at highest capacity for domestic needs as well as export, depends the rebuilding of the German economy. We strive therefore for its technical advancement and its organizational coordination by the initiative of its participants. Since employers and employees have agreed on the basis of labor associations, we promote this agreement toward the goal of peaceful progressive development of our economy. Freedom of economic initiative must be preserved for the entrepreneur corresponding to their exercise of responsibility. Motivated by such views, we will accord to German industry every lawful support and will welcome, to this end, the active participation of representatives of industry and commerce in the life of our Party.

<p>A strong middle class appears to us economically and socially indispensable. Thus we desire its protection by legislation, as guaranteed in the Constitution, and extensive governmental support for private initiative in trades and small commerce, especially for the purpose of supplying raw materials and participating in government contracts. In contrast to excessive communalization efforts, the independence of popular-based handicraft and commerce is to be upheld. The future of trade and commerce is to be assured by training of a new generation in trades and professions.

<p>For the ranks of workers in industry and agriculture, in commerce and the trades, the Center Party stands by its legacy of loyalty. We stand for the further implementation of the legislation already undertaken to assure and expand the right of employees – both blue and white collar workers – to have a say in the shaping of our economy. The unified tariff system is to be fully implemented and secured by law. The securing laws are to be appropriate to the new order of things. One of our most important concerns is solving the shortage of housing and providing assistance for moving and setting up homes. We especially support the Christian worker movement because we see in it effective ideas and energies that can only lead to a healing of our sharply divided social and governmental conditions. It is assured of our warmest sympathy and energetic assistance in the struggle for true democracy and in the struggle against the sabotage of our economy.

<p>We recognize a dutiful bureaucracy as one of the most important supports of the state. Thus we stand for securing its economic position. We are cooperating in the creation of a unitary legal code for the bureaucracy. We are striving for a timely rejuvenation of the governmental work force and the promotion of lower and middle-level workers according to their achievements and capabilities.

<p>Alongside all economic groups and interest groups stands 

<blockquote><strong>the academic profession.</strong></blockquote>

<p>They suffer presently from severe multifaceted economic distress. We desire from the state, therefore, far-reaching consideration for the academic professional movement, and generous measures to protect new generations of academics from misery and to create new work opportunities corresponding to their education. Above all, we want an entirely different valuation of intellectual work. Means must be placed at the disposal of academic establishments and research institutions so that they are placed in position to uphold the worldwide reputation of German science as before. Academic freedom must remain assured. Excellence and academic achievement should constitute the only claim to the professorial chairs of German universities. 

<blockquote><strong>Women</strong></blockquote>

<p>have been, by the recent course of events, forced into employment in increasing numbers and introduced into political life. We acknowledge their equal rights in public life and desire that women be drawn into fields they are especially talented in, above all the field of popular education and general caregiving. We demand particular protection for mothers and working women.

<p><strong>Christian men and Christian women in German Lands!</strong>

<p>Step into battle for these lofty goals! We all share in the same fate, in the same distress of a struck down and pauperized people. This shared fate is our common burden, but also our common honor. We bear it with pride and with loyal devotion, to stick together in every distress and danger that the future may bring. Faith in divine providence and in the inner strength of our Christian love will overcome the hardships of these days and lead us to a re-arising. Forget the narrow cares of your private interests and think of the great whole!

Now then, according to what is read in issue No. 394 of the <em>Frankfurter Zeitung</em> of June 1st, the broadsheets of the right are reporting that “a conference took place on Sunday in Berlin of representatives of the German Anti-Ultramontane Union (the <em>Antiultramontaner Reichsverband</em>) - connected to these same parties.

<a name="70"></a><p><strong>June 10, 1920</strong> Pacelli to Gasparri about the June 6th Reichstag elections:

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>The German Reich political elections this time had a very special importance.  They concerned the election of the first Parliament after the proclamation of the Republic and the National Constitutional Assembly, and moreover had to clarify the political situation following the attempted reactionary coup of Kapp and Lüttwitz, as well as the Sovietesque agitations of the proletariat in the Ruhr district. The preparations on the part of not a few parties were more intense and heavy than ever. Expectations were enormous. After the failed Kapp Putsch, the National Assembly, impelled primarily by the leftwing parties, set the elections for June 6, and they in fact took place with great calm as hoped. The definitive results will not be able to be known until after June 23rd. Meanwhile the current Ministerial Cabinet immediately resigned, because the early returns are clearly opposed to its political direction. It has been asked, as counseled, to stay to discharge ordinary business and to maintain order.

<p>From the news thus far, it can easily be concluded what will be the character of the new Reichstag. The known results demonstrate the failure of the Coalition Government, which until now has been in power, and which, as is known, was composed of the Socialists, Democrats and Center Party. This failure is now irreparable, as it seems to exclude the possibility that a new and lasting Cabinet could be formed solely by the three aforementioned parties. On the contrary, the strength of the two parties of the right has been notably increased, namely the German National People’s Party and the German People’s Party, corresponding to the former Conservatives and Nationalist-Liberals. As is known, then, these parties were for the most part formed of Protestants, but recently a notable group of Catholics of conservative tendencies broke off from the Center Party and joined themselves, at least for this occasion, to the German Nationals, and also founded their own weekly periodical, “Mein Glaube,” [My Faith] whose first issue appeared May 25th. Also, the Independent Socialists have seen an increase in their ranks from all those discontented with the Majority Socialists. In sum, the elections have given a notable preponderance to the extreme parties of right and left at the expense of the parties in the middle. 

<p>The cause of this phenomenon is two-fold. It is to be found both in domestic policy and foreign policy. 

<p>In domestic policy, the election results signify a clear, open opposition of the great part of the German people to the so-called coalition policy, which was, and could not be anything but, a policy of half measures and compromises. It naturally could not satisfy either the right or the left: not the right, because it did not sufficiently pursue the interests of the bourgeoisie and the middle classes; not the left, because it did not sufficiently pursue the socialization that was in its program and in the expectations of many of its adherents. It was expected by both sides that the Government could do more than it actually could under current circumstances. So now the disillusionments of the one side and the other have been marshaled against the Government, and the one side with the extreme right, the other with the extreme left, have sought to bring about their desired policies: the bourgeoisie, that is, with the Conservatives or Nationalist-Liberals, the Socialists with the Independent Socialists. As for what concerns foreign policy, the result of the elections represents all too clearly the reaction of the German people against the peace imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. A rebirth of nationalism was almost inevitable following this peace, which was accepted only by force and against the will of the conservative parties and not only them. The agitation produced by the conditions dictated by Versailles, some of which are considered extremely harsh, and others even impossible to fulfill, has driven anew a large part of the bourgeoisie toward those parties that have been first and foremost strong proponents of the war policy of Germany.

<p>Indeed the Center Party has suffered, as it seems at this point, significant losses in this election.  Its policy, accused of being too favorable to the proletariat, has caused it to lose many supporters from the middle classes. Moreover the hostility to Erzberger, who is the object of hostility on the part of very large numbers, has also hurt the Center Party. Good results have been experienced by the Bavarian People’s Party, which, as is known, separated from the Center Party for its known federalistic tendencies. In the event that an alliance could currently succeed between the Bavarian People’s Party and the Center Party, this will also have a notable influence in the new Government. No party has an absolute majority. Neither the extreme right nor the extreme left can govern alone. The Socialists have declared they will not enter into a Cabinet together with the German Nationals (former Conservatives), whom until yesterday they have accused of being responsible for the enormous catastrophe to the German people. The Independent Socialists refuse to participate in a Ministry of the Majority Socialists, who do not believe they could accept their program of vast socialization. A cabinet of a coalition between the extreme right and extreme left is obviously impossible because of the enormous distance that separates their respective programs. There is thus much groping in the dark, and the most widespread prediction of what will soon be seen (if it is even possible) is either new elections or a profound class struggle, which could also lead to civil war.

<p>In fact just two-thirds of the Parliament would be able to bring about an amendment of the Constitutional Charter of the Reich. In the program itself of the Independent Socialists, in which a vast plan of socialization and innovation is espoused in a more or less Sovietesque sense, there is not a word about religious issues. Nevertheless it is natural that, if the present dark situation should lead (as not a few fear) to violent conflicts, the Church also could easily experience extremely grave harm.

<blockquote>Re: Political elections in Bavaria

<p>The elections to the Bavarian Landtag took place, like those for the Reichstag, on the 6th of this month...

<p>Indeed in Bavaria, as in the Reich, there has been grave dissatisfaction with the parties of the center, in favor of the extremes. Here in Bavaria, however, the most revealing victory has been that of the Bavarian People’s Party. It has not gained an absolute majority, but a plurality of votes ...

<p>Given that the Bavarian People’s Party shall assume power, it is not without interest to know the directions that will guide its future policy and that are espoused by Deputy Held, the Head of the same Party's delegation to the Landtag ... The program of the Party will be a program of order and reconciliation... Maintenance of order and tranquility at whatever cost; the civic guard (Einwohnerwehr), the army (Reichswehr) and the police (Polizeiwehr) must not be touched. Bavaria must be freed from all threatening elements. There will need to be cultivation of a religious and moral renewal of the people by every means... 

<p>In the aforesaid Assembly there was also discussion of the direction to be followed by the Deputies of the Bavarian People’s Party in the German Reichstag and the question of eventual participation by this Party in the central government of the Reich. A Reichstag Deputy, Canon Leicht, said that if the Party is called to participate in the Berlin government, the first condition must be the preservation of Bavaria’s autonomy at all cost. For a closer collaboration with the Center Party (it is known that the Bavarian People’s Party is distinct from the Center), the condition <i>sine qua non</i> must be that Deputy Erzberger not have any post in the Government...</blockquote>

I hope that he will remain faithful to these intentions.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Catholics and the Jewish Question” 

<p>How deeply the Jewish agitation – conducted under the cloak of Freethinking and Enlightenment – against everything cherished by non-Jews – has wounded the sentiments of our <em>Volk</em>, is shown by the following open letter to Publisher Müller of the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em> [Bavarian Courier], which was handed to us.

<p>Herr Dr. Müller, Publisher of the <em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>!

   <p>On the occasion of a meeting called by the Israelite Community of Munich in the Bavarian Hof Hotel, at which a Dr. Holländer of Berlin spoke against antisemitism, you said in the discussion period:  that from your standpoint you have no objection to raise concerning your Israelite fellow citizens, and that you deeply regret that there are Catholics who participate in antisemitism.  You apologize thereby that such Catholics have long ago abandoned their faith and really are no longer Catholics.  You say this considering the severe accusations leveled against the Jews not only by laymen, but also by real scholars, even by university professors, and in the face of books, journals and newspapers written by Jews that daily preach against the Holy Father, against the doctrines of the Church, against the clergy, against the Catholic religion in general.  That the Lord God has not imparted feelings and character equally, I have known from my childhood.  If our Catholic Church had not found fighters along the way, then it would long ago have ceased being what it is today.  But love for enemies has a limit.  Even you will not demand of a Catholic that he must not believe the severe accusations against the Jews (see the Talmud).  Hopefully you also stand on that point.

   <p>As the “<em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>” last year took a position against the heads of the Revolution:  Eisner, Levien, Toller, and identified them as Jews, and also exhorted the Israelite Community no longer to recognize these Jews as Jews, Israel remained silent.  But they have left their Catholic brethren who participate in antisemitism in the lurch.  Does the Catholic teaching: love your neighbor, no longer apply?  I can tell you, God has also not imparted love equally.  
<p>Signed:  A Catholic labor organizer, subscriber to the “<em>Bayerischer Kurier</em>” and the “<em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>.”</blockquote><br>

<blockquote: “Palestine and Zionism: Serious Concerns” – dateline London, July 7 (delayed)

<p>We are able to convey other interesting details about the parliamentary debate on Palestine and Zionism, a debate that has had and still has a widespread echo in these political circles and in the press. Particularly serious is the attitude of the eminent “Morning Post.”  The Government is accused of having supported Zionism too much in Palestine, and for unjustifiable reasons. In order to clarify the policy of the “Foreign Office,” the “Morning Post” has published, as a typographic contrast, a communiqué of the Jewish Correspondence Bureau and some contemporaneous statements made by the Foreign Office in Parliament.  They are indeed worthy of being known for their evident contrast.

<p>The Jewish Correspondence Bureau, according to <em>Reuters</em>, has stated thus:  “Sir Herbert Samuel will solemnify his entry into the office of High Commission for Palestine with a proclamation of amnesty for all those who were convicted in relation to revolutionary uprisings in Jerusalem, and this amnesty will be applicable to Arabs and to Christians and to Jews.”

<p>Specifically to be released is Lieutenant Vladimir Jabotinsky, who was convicted by Court Martial for having organized a Jewish defense corps.

<p>Lord Curzon, on the other hand, expressed to the House of Lords his reasons for not being able to deliver to Lord Sydenham the unofficial report of Mr. Samuel and that of Lord Allenby on the incidents in Jerusalem, as this question was still pending judgment in the courts.

<p>Minister Churchill responded to General Colvin that the court and General Allenby would not render a favorable judgment to Lieutenant Jabotinsky and that he could not justify his actions toward the Arabs.  High Commissioner Samuel will be able to review the case after having consulted Lord Allenby who is the authority on the spot.

<p>Here it can be seen that the Jabotinsky affair will be “judged in the courts” by the British Government, but it will have already been resolved by the Zionists, with the practical result that the Lieutenant will be set free.

<p>“The Judgment of the ‘Morning Post’”

<p>In another attack on the Government, the above-mentioned London newspaper showed itself decidedly hostile to the appointment of Sir Herbert Samuel.

<p>In a region where Jews and Arabs are opposed to each other, and where the passions and prejudices of moderate Jews have been extraordinarily inflamed by bold-spirited Zionists and the animosity they have brought from Central Europe, the British Government has considered it opportune to appoint not a common English citizen but in fact Sir Herbert Samuel.  He may appear to Lord Curzon to be “a man of judgment, comprehension and experience,” but the Arabs will see in him nothing but a Jew.</blockquote><br>

<a name="75ab"></a><p><strong>June 16, 1920</strong> <em>Historisch-Politische Blätter für das Katholische Deutschland</em> [Historical-Political Papers for Catholic Germany], vol. 165, pp. 741-752:

<blockquote>“The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”

<p>In the Vorposten Publishing House (League Against  the Arrogance of Jewry) in Charlottenburg has appeared a book, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” published by Gottfried zur Beek, in which, along with an abundant, often tendentiously hostile collection of materials, details and quotations on the Jewish question, excerpts from minutes of a Zionist Congress in Basel (1897) are reprinted. “Dedicated to the Princes of Europe!” Under the motto of a phrase that Louis XVI uttered upon his arrest on June 22, 1791 in Varennes: “I knew all this already 11 years ago; but how did it come about that I still did not want to believe it?”

<p>As the introduction of the work conveys, the published excerpts of the minutes came in Russian possession through bribery, or through theft according to another version, so that they could be published as early as 1901 by S. Nilus and 1907 by G. Buhmi. Putting off for the moment any critical examination of the authenticity or falsehood of the documents, we want first of all to get an overview of them in their entirety. 

<p>In 24 sessions the “Elders of Zion” develop an “ingenious,” satanic-ingenious plan for the goal of destroying the order of Christian culture and society and the goal of establishing Jewish world rule. Devilish craftiness and devilish use of violence are paired with each other in order to attain the great goal: the transformation of the Christian world into a Jewish world. All of individualism, liberalism, capitalism, democracy-ism, materialism, like all of socialism, servile-ism, communism, autocracy-ism, and spiritualism of Christians-become-pagans is placed at the service of the mania for Jewish world rule, of Talmudic messianism.
<p>With full consciousness, Zion uses destructive, disintegrative enlightenment (revolutionary individualism, etc.) equally with the petrifying, fossilizing spirit of servility (reactionary socialism, etc.). “In our service are men of all viewpoints and political dispositions, enlightenment thinkers and democrats, socialists and communists. We have harnessed all of them under our yoke” (9th Session, p.92). Thesis and antithesis, revolution and reaction alternate in history, but all serves the chosen people of Zion.

<p>The minutes clearly reflect, albeit not systematically, the three historical phases of the modern movement of civilization: the revolutionary thesis of destructive individualism, capitalism, etc., the reactionary antithesis of petrifying socialism, communism, etc., and the Jewish synthesis of the great world rule of the mammon-archs from the seed of Zion, of the false pope and false kaiser in one person, the Talmud-patriarch of a Jewish world that caricatures the Christian world.  The minutes lay out these three phases of history conceptually in three parts, even if the reporting style often intermingles the three spheres. The “Elders” take neither individualism nor socialism seriously; they use both and believe in a quasi-organic order of society that is openly Jewish and caricaturing Christianity, but neither capitalistic nor communistic. They exploit free-thinking for their purposes and goals, just as they exploit slave-thinking.  They determinedly promote destruction in the time of revolution and just as determinedly the petrification in the time of reaction.

<p>The destruction serves: 1. the contagiously-acting enlightenment, the licentiousness, that will only play into the hands of the rule of one new lord, thus individualism (1st Session, p.69); 2. godlessness, which will replace the concept of God and the Holy Spirit in the souls of non-Jews through numerical calculations and bodily needs, thus liberalism (4th Session, p.82); avarice and greed of the non-Jews together with national economics, conceived by Jewish sages and promulgated <em>ex cathedra</em> (5th Session, p.84), thus capitalism, the rule of money promoted by enlightenment, individualism and liberalism (1st Session, p.69); the slogan of liberty, equality and fraternity, “worms that eat away at the prosperity of the non-Jews, since they generally undermine the peace and quiet, the solidarity, and the public spirit of the non-Jews” (1st Session, p.74), a slogan that inevitably breaks up the order of state and society, in combination with so-called popular sovereignty (parliamentary constitutionalism = partisanship, 10th Session, p.97) and their puppet-presidents (p.97), for the elected upstart (1st Session, p.73) as democracy-ism and amateur-ism (2nd Session, p.95) in ignorance of all tradition and good breeding, all races, all natural instincts of calling and position in life; 5. the greed of non-Jews for things, their materialism, “alcohol, humanism and vice” (1st Session, p.72), to which the workers shall especially be accustomed (6th Session, p.88), whereby the Jewish power enhances their debasement, their hunger and their weakness, their hatred and envy (3rd Session, p.78), further “pleasures, games, sports, passions and public houses,” a whole range of diversions for the purpose of distracting from those issues for whose implementation the Jews would otherwise have to struggle hard (13th Session, p.108), finally luxury, thus “seduction of the non-Jews to great expenditure out of all proportion to their income, and finally degenerating into a supercilious life to which everything will unthinkingly be sacrificed” (6th Session, p.88).

<p>In this way Christian society will be systematically hollowed out, Christians will become herd-beast-people and needy slaves of men from hell. If this revolutionizing of all cultural, individual and social life succeeds and Christianity is transformed like every single nation into an atomized Tohu va Bohu [Hebrew, from Genesis 1:2, for “formless and void”] , then, in a reaction, the second act of the whole process sets in: petrification.

<p>If they have previously worked destructively during a long period and for this purpose hidden economic problems behind the political problems they shoved to the front, then they will act in the opposite manner now during the somewhat shorter in duration petrifying, reactionary period (15th Session, p.107). We live in the era of Socialism. We see how the Jewish wolves are driving the mutton on before them (11th Session, p.101), how terrorism and servility are building upon each other, how nevertheless the Jews hardly take utopian Communism seriously (15th Session, p.115), which through their – avoiding all honorable commerce, inciting city and country, and established industry and agriculture – devilish speculation (6th Session, p.91), never losing sight of the preplanned transformation of the golden plutocracy into a red bureaucracy (8th Session, p.91), systematically implementing the autocracy of their world rule, and beginning, by mystically pointing the non-Jews to the “Western doctrines” of a pseudo-religious theosophy, to shore up their rule quasi-metaphysically (13th Session, p.108).  

<p>We know in the modern era, since the Renaissance and Reformation, that alternation between creeping revolution (dissolution) and sudden reaction (petrification), and we know how both Extreme Individualism and Socialism, both Democracy and Autocracy, were used by the Jews for their goal and purpose. The minutes also speak often of inciting the democratic and autocratic factors of a people, those that lead and those that are led, factors that are played off against one another. “In order to instigate the powers that be to an (autocratic) abuse of their authority, we have played all forces against one another, while we have brought the (Jewish influenced, democratic) enlightened viewpoints (of the people) into contradiction with the (princes’) independence of all constitutional limitation. We sought in this way to invigorate each (the autocratic and the democratic) bias, we equipped all the parties. The (interiorly weakened by us) power of the ruler, just like the (well-fed by us) blind power of the people has lost all meaning; for each is helpless on its own like a blind man without a cane” (3rd Session, p.77). “We might fear that the perceptive powers of the (besieged by us) rulers would united with the blind powers of the (ensnared by us) peoples. But we every precautionary measure to prevent this. Between the two powers we have erected a two-sided wall of rule by terror (autocratic on one side, democratic on the other)” (9th Session, p.92).  And the Jews direct Capitalism and Communism both alike: “No worker can count with certainty on a constant wage; he is dependent on the (capitalistic, Jewish-golden, plutocratic) alliance of the lords of industry and on the (Communistic, Jewish-red, bureaucratic) strikes of his fellow workers” (3rd Session, p.78).

<p>The mutually disintegrative revolutions and reactions, long capitalistic-creeping destructive periods and sudden-communistic petrifying periods remained  pagan in nature so long as historical opposite poles were present. First with the complete conquering of all governmental, cultural centers of order in the Central European collapse, and through the final conquering of the last conservative remains of the Middle Ages, the Holy Roman Empire, the Talmud-dream indeed became fulfilled through the simultaneous combination of the present Socialist reaction and the hitherto existing individualistic revolution.  The ongoing historical repetition of thesis and antithesis has finally transformed into a synthesis in our days, which the third part of the Protocols depicts, and for which the systematic organization of Jewry as Freemason Lodges prepared during the two first ever-changing phases, thus during the different modern revolutionary theses and counter-revolutionary antitheses.

<p>Working thus by word and writing – in “all sorts of ways of which the non-Jews have no clue” (5th Session, p.83) – the secretly working Lodge is the Jews’ organizational center.  The “Elders” call it “unconquerable and unshakeable,” a secret organization strengthened by cunning and violence, acting by bribery, deceit and treason, in preparation for the time when the Lodge can no longer be suppressed by any means of power or law (1st Session, pp. 70, 72).

<p>“Since we already form a world power, we are impregnable” (3rd Session , p.80). A head, which must remain out of sight, governs the League. “The plan of our directorate must go forth, in finished form, from one head, for it can never take on a powerful form if innumerable heads work on it. This suffices for us, so that our plans are made with full power and are successfully implemented. Therefore we must not throw the strong-spirited work of our leader to the pigs or indeed let it be carped at in narrow circles” (10th Session, p.96). At the side of the leader stands the main directorate of the Elders, in whose fingers, since Freemasonry really encompasses all secret societies, “the threads of all revolutionary and enlightened-minded efforts run together (15th Session, p.112). For the training of such a type of leader, the purpose is served by specialized schools in which the Jews are taught “how the human soul must be conquered, how the cords of the innermost voices of human nature must be struck and manipulated, upon which we are called to play” (8th Session, p.90).

<p>The struggle of the three-point-brothers against altar and throne, their routine and virtuosity in destroying social classes and nations, must, as the “Elders” further calculate, finally lead to national and international crises, to economic and political crises, to the arising of the social and national question.  Only a united league of all non-Jews could prevent the pre-planned catastrophe that threatens. “Against this danger, however, we are protected by the deeply rooted unbridgeable schism among the non-Jews. Even if a spiritual hero arises in the enemy camp, who would engage in a struggle with us, he would nonetheless be defeated” (5th Session, p.84). And yet the “Elders” fear this personality: “There is nothing more dangerous than the power of the sole personality. If he is gifted with creative powers of the spirit, then he can accomplish more than the millions of people whom we have divided in two. Therefore we must divert the formation of non-Jewish society so that it allows its hands to sink in hopeless weakness in the face of every issue that demands power of action and capability of decisiveness.” (p.86)
<p>Out of universal political and economic chaos, Zion hopes there will come “inflation of wages and prices of necessities” (6th Session, p.88), “upheaval, strife, enmity upon the entire world” (7th Session, p.89), and finally the unleashing of world war (p.89). After this world war, if it should come to a general uprising of Europe against the Jews, then that would be answered by American and Asiatic cannons in the name of the Jews (p.89).

<p>At the same time the world revolution must succeed (14th Session, p.110). The non-Jews, interiorly worn down, will offer the supreme rule to the Jews. In place of the former rulers, the “Terror-ghost” will step forward, called the “supra-national government” (5th Session, p.86). “Once we have accomplished the governmental revolution we have planned, then we will say to the peoples: Everything has gone so horribly wrong, you are all exhausted by suffering and grief. See, we are eliminating the causes of your sufferings: the national isolation of peoples, the borders of countries, the differences in currencies. Then all will acclaim us and do anything for us. The universal popular referendum, systematically planned by us for so long, by which we intend to secure lawfully our rule, will provide their last great service to us. The people will declare themselves for us with unanimous resolution, in order to test us before they pass a judgment upon us” (10th Session, p.95).

<p>Now, however, a historical moment appears to have arrived, to create the great caricature of world-mammon-rule: Demon mammon finds its pope and its emperor in the person of the “Patriarch” from the seed of David, with the serpent as its symbol (3rd Session, p.76). Now follows the crowning of the world ruler, the prince of this world (p.79). The violent rule of the Lodge is actually the support of the king from the blood of Zion (p.80). The self-rule of the Lodge takes the place of constitutions, which are completely eliminated, and the peoples of the earth cry out to the king of the Jews: “Remove the monarchs and give us a single world ruler who will unite us all and eliminate the causes of unending strife – the oppositions between nations, the differences of faith, the borders of states and their efforts at expansion – who will finally bring us peace and quiet, for which we hoped in vain from our rulers and national representatives” (10th Session, p.99). Jewish world rule will be a strict Jew-ocracy, a Jewish dictatorship, an “unshakeable government”(1st Session, p.71), form of self-rule (p.72), a reign of terror, which demands blind and unconditional obedience (p.73). “Our empire shall be marked by such a boundless rule of violence, that at all times and places it must be prepared to nip in the bud any resistance by malcontent non-Jews” (5th Session, p.85). “We will have anyone unmercifully executed who takes up arms against us and our rule. Any founding of a new secret society will likewise be punished with death.” (15th Session, p.110). A new class of nobles will drive out the old nobility (1st Session, p.74). In recognition of the racial laws of organic life, in recognition of the mystical constitution of society, the Jew-ocracy will be a monarchy resting upon the principle of hereditary succession, namely the mammon-archical caricature of a monarchy. “Only a personality who has been trained in tyrannical rule from his youth onward can recognize and act according to the principles of the great instructions for statescraft” (1st Session, p.71). These principles, indeed, shall be handed down from father to son as a family secret (p.73).

<p>The “Elders of Zion” explicitly depict the institutions of the Jewish world for its adherents. Zion wants to establish neither a capitalist-pagan, nor a Communist-pagan, but rather a both-Jewish order of society, that is, a caricature of the Christian order of society. “Pagan democracy and free thinking” have played out, and pagan “autocracy and servility” have also been overcome. The new Jewish freedom will be a matter of right, to which the Jewish authority is obligated (12th Session, p.101). Now also there will be a muzzling of the press, which was previously known to have led the Jews to power, while keeping them still in the shadows, which heaped mountains of gold on the Jews without any concern how this gold made for streams of blood and tears (2nd Session, p.76). “No one shall be allowed to question with impunity the halo of our governmental infallibility” (12th Session, p.102). And to be sure, the muzzling will occur indirectly, by means of high printing taxes, required posting of bonds (p.102), (eventually also by throttling the supply of paper?). “No newspaper, no journal, no book will be allowed to appear without pre-publication review” (p.102). Everything will be centralized in monopoly news bureaus. “Every publisher, printer or bookseller will be required to apply for a special permission permit for the exercise of his trade, which we will immediately shut down for the slightest violation against our instructions” (p.103). A great amount of capital is devoted to tactics for the press, which are of great interest (p.102-105).
<p>“As soon as we have achieved world rule, we will tolerate no other faith but ours alone. For this reason, we must destroy every other faith in God. Our thinkers will uncover every error and inconsistency in the non-Jewish faith confessions. Never, indeed, will a non-Jew be in position to inquire into the deep secrets of our doctrine, because they are a book of seven seals for all non-initiates. Anyone who is initiated, however, will never dare to reveal the secrets of our faith to one who is not called” (14th Session, pp. 109-110).
<p>After the destruction of the Christian faith comes the destruction of the Christian academy. Academic freedom will be removed from the universities, the professors must remain in constant dependency on the government. Teaching of history will be reformed. “We will strike from human memory all historical facts that are uncomfortable for us, and only allow those to survive by which the errors of the non-Jewish governments are especially highlighted.” In education, the new order of societal classes that caricatures Christianity shall also be considered, an order of classes and life that the Jews bear as the nobility of the nations (16th Session, p.119). Lawyers will be “governmentalized,” the police “socialized,” especially since all Jew-loyal citizens will furnish services as spies and informants (17th Session, p.121, 123).

<p>A broad expanse is filled with finance problems (20th and 21st Sessions, p.127-138). A graduated scale of property taxes shall symbolize the fairness of the Jew-ocracy. “The power by which our king will be supported consists in the fair allocation of tax burdens, which is a major civil measure for domestic tranquility. For the sake of this domestic tranquility, property owners must hand over to the state a portion of their income. The state’s need for money shall be borne by those who live in superfluity and from whom there is something to take” (p.128). In the state treasury, there will always be only a certain amount at hand for cash payments, all the rest will be put into circulation. The future currency will not be the gold standard that was a ruin for every state that took it up. (“The gold standard could all the less satisfy the monetary needs of peoples as we removed gold from circulation to the extent possible and made new editions of bank notes dependent upon gold reserves” p.131.) The new monetary standard should be based on the cost of living, the money supply must be brought into accord with the size of the population. The currencies themselves can be of paper, wood or metal. “We will calculate the average monetary need of a citizen by the average cost of living and then place as much money in circulation as correspondents with the aggregate needs of the population” (p.132). All safe long-term interest-bearing government bonds, which draw away money from the non-Jews in the interest of the Jews, who suck themselves full like leeches on the sick body of the non-Jewish state until it goes under from loss of blood (p.133), will be done away with. “The only allowable form of government bonds will be short-term with 1% interest (series) at the responsibility of the treasury department” (p.134). Stock exchange securities must be exchanged for governmental bank notes, state securities under a lawful rate remain issued, all commercial paper becoming dependent on this state stock exchange.

<p>How the entire reform proposal of the minutes is generally for the creation of a pseudo-Christian, caricatured Christian order of classes and fee holdings is carried out, upon the establishment of a quasi-organic order of society with a Jewish noble class; thus also the individual reforms, as they are described in the 23rd Session (p.140): Restriction of the production of luxury items, re-establishment of cottage industries and dismantling of large industrial concerns, promotion of home production and elimination of unemployment, prohibition of drunkenness. A new society shall arise, upheld by the nobility of “God’s Chosen People,” who congregate around the throne of the King of the Jews. This world ruler will preserve the appearance of the reign of antiquity. The people will idolize him as the Patriarch of the World (15th Session, p.118). The King of the Jews will become the real pope of the Jewish world church (17th Session, p.123). He will not have himself guarded by police, but rather by plain-clothes agents; the people will give him everything (18th Session, p.125). Everyone is allowed, for appearance, to submit petitions and suggestions (19th Session, p.126). The new rule will be infallible (12th Session, p.106). The king, on proud moral high ground, shall embody the destiny of the people, he and the three Elders alone may unveil the future (24th Session, p.141). With this grandiose prospect of a domination (papacy, empire and kingdom in one person!) guaranteeing order, peace and tranquility, the minutes conclude.

<p>There remains for us the question of the authenticity or falsehood of the Protocols. It must first be put forward that the described virtuosity and routine of revolutionary dissolution and reactionary petrification is certainly authentic, also that the Jewish world order’s caricature of the Christian order of classes and life corresponds to known facts, that the Jews equally caricature everything, and that in their religion and in their race they actually represent nothing other than the caricature of noble humanity. Even if the three phases, which we may call the revolutionary-capitalistic thesis, the reactionary-Communist antithesis, and the Jewish-demonic-mammon-archy synthesis, are rightly perceived and depicted, there are nevertheless intrinsic and extrinsic reasons for doubting the authenticity of the document. The Jew is cunning and brutal, criminal and dumb, he has routine and virtuosity, but he lacks any brilliance that is the necessary presupposition to serve any conception that is so grandiose. Also, his striving for world domination, as expressed in the above three phases, remains instinctive, which frankly does not rule out that the three “Elders of Zion” might be reflexively addicted to their Talmud-dreams. Whether this occurred in Basel? Extrinsic considerations speak also against that: The diction and style of the minutes, which appear to betray the setting as Russian. Also the fact that the arch-enemy of the eternal Jew, namely the eternal Christ, the Church, is only mentioned three times, which could be advanced as evidence, in the event one does not want to believe there was an alteration, which is further thereby apparent, that without any doubt authentic elements were inserted. Of the Church, the “Elders” speak in the 5th Session (p.84): “Can it be a matter of indifference to the world who rules it, the head of the Catholic Church or our dictated King of the blood of Zion?” Further in the 15th Session (p.111), where the Czar, “aside from the Pope,” is called the sole earnest enemy of Judaism. Finally, yet again in the 17th Session (p.122), where it says: “As soon as the time has come to destroy finally the power of the Pope, the finger of an invisible hand will point the peoples to the Papal Curia. If they rush to it to take revenge for centuries-long oppression, then we will want to step up as the presumptive protectors o the Pope and prevent a huge bloodbath. By means of this artificial tactic, we will make it into the innermost chambers of the Papal Curia and will not leave them until we have gotten to the bottom of all the mysteries, and until the entire power of the Papacy is completely broken.”

<p>Whether at the end of the day the minutes are authentic or false, they exude throughout, in any event, the Jewish spirit, even if the authorship may not be Jewish. They reveal completely the reflexive active striving for world domination that is instinctive in the Jews and perhaps also in some “Elders of Zion.” All the details of the destructive or petrifying, anarchistic or mechanistic activity of the Jews are common characteristics of the race, alive in the blood, working instinctively. The proposition that a spiritual headquarters must exist, giving its instructions, is entirely superfluous. Racial Jews will always and everywhere show up and act in the same manner in all situations in their behavior toward non-Jews, even without special instructions. That is precisely the secret of Jewish success, that the Jew instinctively acts, instinctively denies the idea of Christ and affirms the demonic-mammonistic Jew-Ahasuerus delusion.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”

<p>From the Jewish side, the authenticity of the meeting minutes of the Elders of Zion is again being heavily disputed. As to this, the following is to be noted: Even if the minutes are not historical in the full meaning of that word, still the history books by Jewish authors, just like those by serious nonpartisan German researchers, show us nothing other than that the content of the disputed book is completely true to the character of the Jewish spirit of power-greed, money-greed, and destruction, down to the most detailed explicit reflection of it. Should the veil over its authorship not be capable of being completely lifted beyond dispute, we also have to thank for that the Jewish effort, for longstanding good reason, not to let the truth about it come to light. For us the book is a Völkisch revelatory writing, because every proposition in it can be proven from other indisputable historical sources, and thus we may and will quote relevant passages from it as occasion arises. Moreover, the position of “even if it comes from the Jewish side,” is hardly proof of anything; and so long as the Jews do not produce clear incontestable proof that the content of the book is fabricated, we also have no need to believe that their congresses for the ethnic identity of their business people are “harmless” and “innocuous,” while a considerable anthology of opposite reports can be put together daily from their Jewish-national papers (“Jewish Rundschau,” “The Jewish Echo,” etc.) It is also remarkable in this regard that an exemplar of the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” has been in an English library since 1906, and the present day shows that historical events have been playing out, and are still, almost literally in the exact ways these plans would have them go.

<p>Moreover, one of our collaborators will report insightfully yet again on this in a later issue of the “Observer,” and will give the answer to Jewish objections.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Palestine had for centuries been almost derelict, politically and materially.  We had to build, from the very beginning, a modern state.  Further, the country was suffering from the effects of several years of war.  Great armies had fought over it; many of its villages had been destroyed; trees cut down wholesale, orange-groves neglected, livestock depleted; there was a general air of poverty and depression.  Brigandage was rife in many districts and the Bedu had been raiding across the Eastern border.  The capital had lately been the scene of a serious racial riot.</blockquote>

<p>How deeply religious life is already being shaken in many sectors of society by the outrageous efforts of fallen away sects, by shameful slanders and distortions, is apparent in may ways. Allegedly many “nationalist” Sokol [Falcon] associations (so name on account of the falcon feather, or falcon, that they wear as their symbol) are planning for people to leave the Catholic Church at the conclusion of the big holiday ceremonies on July 6th, the date of the death of John Hus. If all the signs are not misleading, the Church in Bohemia is facing serious religious convulsions. - Also in Moravia the movement to leave the Church is gaining ground in a frightful manner.  Thus the Social Democrat newspaper “Rovnost” in Brno is appealing to all party members to leave the Church on July 5th in memory of John Hus and to form associations of unbelievers.  In this the Social Democrats are again boasting, especially at election time, of their ostensible principle: Religion is a private matter!  Also the Sokol associations, who are celebrating their World Congress with massive participation in these days - from America alone more than 600 Sokols have recently arisen - should at all cost be torn free from Rome.  In a flaming appeal to the Sokols it is said: “...we are and must be against Catholicism, even if many are still perhaps apparently adherents.  It is necessary to proclaim this loudly and show it by deeds.  Brothers, sisters, do not be deceived! The reckoning with Rome stands before us... From all sides the open, unveiled, true Sokol solution will ring out: No Sokol member can be a Roman! Sokols, ever onward! ... Free from Rome!”  Until now they have hidden behind the hypocritical slogan: Clericalism; now they are saying openly: We are against Catholicism! The distinguishing of spirits is everywhere apparent.  Freethinkers, Socialists, Sokols and others in raging struggle against the Church.  Behold, the synagogue of Satan!

In Jerusalem, armed Indian troops are patrolling the streets day and night.  The Jews are now calling Palestine “the land of Israel,” the Arabs call it “South-Syria.” May the Lord God thwart these two crown-pretenders and bestow the Holy Land upon the Christians! This issue is seething at the moment in the newspapers; even on the street, the one side reads it in Hebrew, the other in the Arabic newspapers.  Yesterday it was reported that the English wanted to hoist their flags, but it did not happen. The prospects for a peaceful solution to the Jewish- and Arab-question are negligibly slight. - The harvest has begun.  The weather is comfortable.  After Easter 60 more wagons of flour arrived from overseas.  Brother Lucas, who is well known to many Munich pilgrims, was recently buried.

<p>The establishment of an Embassy of the Reich in Rome and the correlative institution of an Apostolic Nunciature in Berlin represent an event of historical importance in the development of the relations between the Apostolic See and Germany and at the same time are a solemn recognition of the beneficent and impartial works of the Holy Father, Who, situated above human passions, was during the War the vindicator of law, the angel of charity, and the supporter of a just peace, and now continues to placate, with a tireless fatherly hand, the sufferings caused by inhuman conflicts, and to promote reconciliation of peoples based on Christian principles of truth and justice.

<p>But to give back to the people of Germany, severely tried by such grave upheavals, the stable tranquility necessary for all solid reconstruction and lasting progress, His Holiness values this high moment of concord between the ecclesiastical and civil powers.  That is why the Sovereign Pontiff has given me the high charge of dealing with the competent Authorities to regulate ex novo the relations between Church and State in Germany, in a manner corresponding to the new situation and to current needs.

<p><strong>From the Holy Land.</strong> According to the peace treaty with Turkey, the protection of the Holy Places will be entrusted to an English commission under the control of the League of Nations, the protection of minorities is transferred to the League of Nations, and the Catholic Protectorate is eliminated. - In Palestine, despite the British Mandate recognized at San Remo, this is still not ordained to ever result in a just peace.  The Moslem population, which actually forms the great majority in the country, does not trust the promise that their previous possession of the land will not be affected and that only limited new Jewish immigration will be allowed; for they know by experience the power of Jewish money.  The Jews are complaining just as much, and they say they are worse off than in Turkish times, because the taxes are higher, the level of commerce is less, life is more expensive, and colonies are sometimes exploited, sometimes left in danger. In this they are disunited among themselves, as the recent election by the Jewish community in Jerusalem showed, and most of them want nothing to do with Zionism.  Of the 84 seats in their special Jewish council, 63 went to long-established Jewish residents. Germans living in Haifa and both neighboring communities, mostly descendants of the Germans from Württemberg who have lived there for more than 50 years, are increasingly losing hope that they will be able to remain in the country. The German Borromeo society can continue to work in peace; and it is gratifying that beginning in May of this year, seven German novices, mostly from Silesia, could take holy vows at their “Elijah” institute on Mt. Carmel. The Carmelite monastery that suffered so much during the war is now inhabited by seven mostly Spanish monks and is developing under the tireless English superior, Father Lamb, with new blood.  Herbert Samuel has been appointed High Commissioner (Governor) of Palestine.  He belongs to the respected Jewish family of Montagu and is known as a law-observant Israelite.  Born in Liverpool in 1870, he has been a Member of Parliament since 1902 and is counted among the leaders of the Liberal Party.  The appointment of Herbert Samuel as British High Commissioner in Palestine is closely connected with the policy being followed by England in Palestine.  The Holy Land is to be placed under Jewish influence, to become a Jewish state under the English protectorate.  Yet the Christians just like the Muslims of Palestine are determined adversaries of this plan and have formed a union together for the purpose of representing their common interests.  It is profoundly deplorable that Catholics in the various countries have not developed the same adeptness as the Zionist Jews in the highly important Palestinian questions, and thus the Holy See could only raise and succeed with modest demands at San Remo. For the same reason it is also extraordinarily regrettable that the International Catholic Palestine Congress, most recently scheduled for July 12th to 16th in Einsiedeln [Switzerland], after repeated announcements and reschedulings, has once again been postponed, for an indeterminate time.</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Action Française</em> has published correspondence from an eyewitness of the entry of Sir Herbert Samuel, High Commissioner for Palestine, into Jerusalem.

<p>On July 30th the correspondent wrote:  a 1:00 p.m. the British troops, with fixed bayonets, barred all the roads.  At two o’clock a locomotive entered the station, two hundred meters ahead of the special train that carried the High Commissioner.  Almost no one had been alerted to his arrival.  A procession was arranged.  Four armored cars with machine guns preceded and followed the car in which Sir Herbert Samuel took his post.  Then came two trucks with English soldiers in campaign uniforms.  Between two rows of bayonets, in a profound silence, the procession went up the Mount of Olives.  Some aircraft circled in the sky, as during the bloody week of Easter [anti-Jewish riot in Jerusalem].

<p>When the High Commissioner arrived at Mount Scopus, a battery began to fire a periodic series of shots.  The British flag was flying over the hospital of St. Paul, the residence of a German official which has now become the new home of the Commissioner.

<p>And this is the way, comments <em>L’Action</em>, that the peace treaty is being carried out, a treaty to realize the noble ideals of President Wilson for the independence of people and the protection of small States: the English Jew Sir H. Samuel is the arbiter of Palestine by the will of Great Britain, and the condescendence of the Allies makes a glorious entry for him into Jerusalem... Some London papers have written of a triumphal entry.  Indeed, according to a Zionist correspondent of the London press, the entire population, Christians and Muslims, had received Sir Samuel with loud vivas and acclamations, and their enthusiasm had overflowed when amnesty was proclaimed for those convicted for the Easter uprisings.

<p>“The Russian-Polish War”

<p>An article in the <em>Tribune</em>, as to which we do not know, in truth, whether what predominates more is obscurity of thought or contortion of style, comments on the Pontifical letter to the Cardinal Vicar about prayers for Poland, categorizing it, with blatant incompetence, as the same as other recent documents that have very different purposes.  We do not follow the author of the article in his many inaccuracies, in several affirmations that are so unfounded as to be grotesque, which he knew, in a manner that cannot be believed, all collected together into a few lines with a sectarian geniality: we observe only that he sees in the letter a new denunciation “of the anti-Christian essence of Socialism” while he finds a direct contradiction in the pious exhortation in favor of Poland, because this is what provoked the new war.

<p>Now the Pontifical document hopes and implores exactly for the salvation of the national existence of Poland and of Europe from the menace of new wars.  Of Socialism, Communism and Bolshevism, it says not a word; and not a mention that could authorize and justify statements such as that of the <em>Tribune</em> about responsibility for this war.

<p>If there is anyone here who is “harming a hair of the truth” – and not just one hair – it is indubitably our contradictor.  He has also forgotten that the choice and desire of the Holy Father correspond perfectly with the expressed desires of Great Britain, France and Italy, as to keeping intact the unfortunate new State and sparing Europe new woes; and correspond to the intent of the simple and highly reasonable motion of the English Prime Minister, who said very clearly in the House of Commons, according to the news today, that it is one thing to admit the responsibility of Poland in its first offensive and another to admit the destruction of its national independence, which would be a crime.

<p>To be able to write what the <em>Tribune</em> published under the headline “The Pole and Poland” requires not only a failure to read the last document and an ignorance of the social and civil thinking of the Church, it requires an open purpose of criticizing and denigrating, whatever the cost.  Even at the cost of ignoring – even in the columns of a Government-affiliated newspaper! – the traditions of fraternal solidarity with Poland, which the Liberals of Italy have fed ever since the two nations were both subjected, at the same time, to foreign domination.</p>

We have already become accustomed to being called horrible creatures and what is considered especially horrible is that we indeed walk point on an issue that mostly gets on people’s nerves, namely the question of opposing the Jews. They understand so much about us, but this one thing they do not want to understand ...

<p>p.191: The Jew later understood how to insinuate himself into a state, especially emerging Rome.  We can follow his trail in southern Italy.  There he has already settled everywhere 2-1/2 centuries before Christ, and he is beginning to be offputting.  He is already talking big, he is the merchant, and it is said in many Roman writings that was treating everything there already the way he does today, from shoelaces all the way to maidens (very right!), and we know that finally the danger became greater and greater and that the uprising after the murder of Julius Caesar was first and foremost incited by Jews.  The Jew already understood then very well how to present himself to the lords of this earth.  And when their lordship began to get shaky, then he started to become the Jew of the people and all at once disclosed his wide-open heart for the needs of the broad masses.  Now we know the same course of events right in Rome.  We know that it was precisely the Jew who made use of Christianity, not out of love for Christianity, but rather in part just from the realization that this new religion above all rejected earthly might and supreme power, recognizing only a higher supernatural lord, and that this religion had to lay the axe to the root of the Roman state, which was built upon the power of the authorities, and he became the bearer of this new religion, its greatest disseminator, and he utilized it not to become Christian himself, that is something he absolutely could not do, he remained always the Jew, exactly as today our socialist of Jewish race never lowers himself to the worker, but rather always remains the lord and plays the socialist (bravo and handclapping)...

<p>pp.198-99:  These proletarian-feeling people are some Jewish billionaiares, and we know full well that over these 2 or 3 proletarians, at the end of the day, exists another organization, which is not at all within the state, but rather outside it: the Alliance Israelite and its grandiose propaganda and directing organization, the special organization of Free Masonry ...

<p>p.202: Then this gentleman thinks our movement means a struggle that the labor movement should be brought into.  Yes, that we would promise our people  God knows what sort of kingdom of heaven, such as these gentlemen have done for 40 long years and now have nothing more than a heap of rubble instead of a kingdom of heaven, a filthy heap of misery, that is something we want nothing to do with.  (Bravo!)  We promise no heavenly kingdom other than this one, that if you want to implement this reform in Germany, perhaps one day the time will arrive again in which the individual can live.  If you implement the glorious reform that these gentlemen here desire, you will even more quickly find yourself needing to pretty things up by exactly the same decrees that your leaders Trotsky and Lenin etc. are now issuing: Whoever is not ready to fight for the blessings of this state, he dies.   

<p>Finally he said they combat every form of capitalism.  My esteemed listeners!  The communists have up to now merely combatted industrial capital merely hanged industrial capitalists perhaps.  But you name me one Jewish capitalist whom they have hanged.  (Very right!)  300,000 Russians have in fact been murdered.  That is something the Soviet government itself now admits.  Among the 300,000 is not a single Jew!  But in the leadership more than 90% are Jews.  Is that really persecution of Jews or is it in the truest sense of the word persecution of Christians?</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“The Circumstances of Palestine in a Speech by Cardinal Bourne at the Liverpool Congress”

<p>Dateline Liverpool, July 30

<p>In an important keynote address today that stirred unanimous approbation among the numerous other speakers, His Eminence Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, observed that Catholic Action worldwide has entered into a new phase, with special interest for the English-speaking world, dealing at length with two questions: the present and future circumstances of Palestine, and the progress of the foreign missions in the new situation created by the War.

<p>Given the importance the English language has acquired, and the resulting widespread dissemination of British news, the words of Cardinal Bourne could bring a large number of readers his beneficent teaching for the good of the Church.  The Cardinal recalled the taking of Jerusalem towards the end of 1917; an occupation that gladdened English Catholics in a special way because it occurred by means of British soldiers.

<p>Nevertheless this joy was followed by a period of notable apprehension.  According to the decisions of the San Remo Conference, Britain obtained the mandate for Palestine, and at the end of June a High Commissioner was sent, in the person of Sir Herbert Samuel.

<p>In that there is nothing alarming, because Sir H. Samuel has gained universal esteem for his rectitude.  But there remains the severe problem that the administration of Palestine is faced with elements of unique character.  On November 8, 1917, Mr. Balfour wrote to Lord Rothschild, promising that the British Government would be favorable to the re-establishment in Palestine of a National Land of the Jews.

<p>The promise was repeated at various points in time and obtained formal approval at San Remo.

<p>“The Zionist Peril”

<p>Certainly there is widespread realization in Europe that numerous groups of Jews have not yet been assimilated in various nations and can constitute domains of dissidents and agitators. For that reason it is hoped by some that these vulnerabilities can be eliminated by establishing for the Jews a territorial and national center of attraction.

<p>But it is also certain that there could be not the slightest illusion that the more elevated classes among the Jews will leave England, France, Germany and Italy to establish themselves permanently in the new State.  Thus the project appears to be absolutely lacking in practicality.

<p>Moreover it is a troubling fact that a strong non-Christian influence is being deliberately constituted in this region, from which Christians have been trying for centuries to remove a non-Christian Power; also just as troubling is that many, even those without the slightest antisemitic prejudice, are justifiably asking what is the reason for such a radical departure from traditional lines.

<p>It is true that definitive assurances have been given that no political dominion will be conceded to this new immigrant population, but these assurances are very far from satisfying the original inhabitants of Palestine and the Europeans.

<p>When I had the personal consolation of visiting Jerusalem in January 1919, continued His Eminence, men of all classes and religions came to see me; they were Latin rite and Greek rite, Melkite and Orthodox, Christian and Moslem.  All of them, with one voice, openly protested against the promise of Mr. Balfour and against the projects of the Zionists.  And they assured me that the promise and the projects would be seriously harmful to British prestige.

<p>Certainly if any importance should be given to the right of self-determination of peoples, these projects cannot be justified.  The many serious meddlings by the Zionists are well known to our officials.

<p>Upon returning from my trip, I did not fail to convey many precise facts to the authorities.  As a result I received many letters from Christians and Muslims who were resisting the Zionist invasion.  They were poor people, often without homes, while the Jews had notable financial means at their disposal, and at least in this respect were already dominators.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote><strong>The Danger to Christianity in Palestine.</strong> The new Jewish Governor Henry [sic: Herbert] Samuel, appointed by England, has instituted Saturday as the official day of rest, which he also observes personally. All Jewish officials in the civil and military service are obligated to observe the sabbath. Moreover the Muslims can remain away from their offices on Friday, and the Christians on Sunday, so that actually on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the governmental services in Palestine will always be partially inactive. The Holy Father has most warmly congratulated Patriarch Barlassina, via the Cardinal Secretary of State, for his project to establish an activity for the preservation of the faith in Palestine. The new circumstances make it urgently necessary to devote all attention not only to the preservation of the Holy Places, but also to the preservation of the Catholic faith in Palestine.  Not only because Jewry knows how to secure ever more influence for itself, but also because various American sects are trying to lure apostates under the pretense of humanitarian activities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Most Reverend Eminence,

<p>In my respectful Report No. 17150 dated June 26th this year, I explained to Your Most Reverend Eminence the political situation in Germany...

<p>The German people are following at the present time, with great anxiety, the development of events in the East.  The victorious advance of Bolshevism is raising a whole series of questions, whose weight and consequences are impossible to measure at this time.  Germany is studying attentively how to exploit these events in its favor.  It signed the Treaty of Versailles with clenched teeth and without a domestic consensus ...

<p>Now it is exactly in the Russian events and the collapse of Poland that many believe they see the opportunity for such a major revision of the Treaty of Versailles...

<p>I had just finished writing these lines this morning when Bavarian Minister von Kahr came to visit me after midday, for precisely the purpose of talking with me about Bolshevism, which he considers to be the most serious question in the world at the moment... The Minister President thinks that Bavaria, together with the other States of southern Germany, will eventually be able to organize an effective action against the Bolshevik tide.  It is for that reason, he affirmed, that the Bavarian Government does not intend, come what may, to disarm the civic guard or <em>Einwohnerwehr</em>, which is the only guarantee for the protection of public order.  When I observed that Germany has nonetheless assumed such an obligation in the Spa conference and that, in case of non-fulfillment of that obligation, the Entente would have occupied the Ruhr Valley, he answered me that France (and of this the Government in Berlin is also persuaded) is resolved to carry out such an occupation in any event, which is thus inevitable and only a matter of time. I fear that this solution of Mr. von Kahr may be a little simplistic ...

<p>“The Bolshevik Regime in Kiev” – dateline Vienna, Aug. 13

<p>The Christian Social newspaper of Vienna, the <em>Reichspost</em>, published a horrifying report on August 10th by a distinguished lady of Kiev, who escaped execution at the last moment for capital punishment decreed upon her by the “Bolsheviks,” and who arrived fortunately in Vienna a few days later.

<p>The reader will be able to understand how much the Bolsheviks are hostile to Christianity and how it is only misguided souls and the totally ignorant who can defend and propagate their theories, which are the negation of all civilization.

<p>All peoples must unite in helping unfortunate Poland, which is combatting this terrible enemy, and in defending their own homes with all means and with the greatest energy against the infamous propagandists of “Bolshevism” – these true enemies of Christian civilization – who “unfortunately infest every country today with impunity.”...

One of the bloodthirsty Jews found his principal entertainment in calling out to men near him who were facing imminent execution, pointing his revolver in their face, ordering them to open their mouth so he could shoot into it, and then sending them off with a smile and the words, ‘not yet today!’”</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“The 6th English Catholic Congress”

<p>In Liverpool, the center of Catholic life in England, the 6th English Catholic Congress took place and was the occasion for an important proclamation. Even if we regret with deepest sorrow that the English Cardinal Bourne did not summon up the extent of love and justice toward us Germans that appeared appropriate to us, nor toward our German missionaries, we nevertheless do not want to withhold from our readers the content of the two main parts of the speech.

<p>Cardinal Bourne’s speech, which opened the Congress, was an extremely noteworthy Church policy proclamation, in some ways a program for Catholicism worldwide. Addressing the new era tht has come upon mankind, he considered the establishiment of the Jewish State as an unmistakable marker of the change in the times.  With the greatest bitterness, the Cardinal criticized the position of the British Government in the Balfour Declaration (Nov. 8, 1917) to Rothschild, that the British Government would pursue with great favor the establishment of the Jewish State.  This repeatedly cited Declaration found its sanction at San Remo.  The proposition was unique, without precedent.  He did not believe that the statesmen who created it would have imagined its immediate, not to mention its ultimate, fine consequences. The Cardinal then described his trip to Palestine, where protests against the obligations imposed by the Balfour Declaration were brought to him from all elements of the population, from Latins, Greeks, Melchites, Orthodox, Christians and Muslims.  Then Cardinal Bourne explained further that he had just recently received a letter, in which it was said that if things were to keep going in this way, soon the whole land would be bought up by the Zionists. Many fields of activity are already in their hands, a bank has been established, which gives the Jews loans at three percent and the Christians loans at ten percent or even higher.  The cornerstone of a Hebrew University has been laid, and in a few years the Jews will have a monopoly in every field there.  That is not what the revolting Christians and Arabs fought against the Turks for, nor allied themselves with the English for, nor spilled their own blood for.  But the first thing that the liberators of Palestine had to experience after the liberation of the Holy Places was the “Balfour Declaration.”  These warriors had not imagined in their dreams that this country liberated by them would be handed over by England in such a manner to such an avaricious people.

<p>The Cardinal described a second great danger for Catholic interests in the widespread proselytism in Palestine by the “American interdenominational world movement,” which is trying to snatch up the orphanages and schools of the Catholics, by means of the enormous sums of money at its disposal.

<p>To oppose the Zionistic peril, at the suggestion of the Cardinal, the Congress asked for the establishment of the post of “liaison officer” for the purpose of vindicating Catholic interests with the governing authorities; informing and meeting with the Commission for decisions about the possession of the Holy Places, representation of all the nations present there for defense of their national claims to the Holy Places, and care for the Catholic schools and institutes in the Holy Land.

<p>In the second point of his program, the Cardinal considerred the future of the missions ...

<p>Also, the speech of Cardinal Gasquet (O.S.B.) contained no points of high policy...

<p>Less confortable for the British Government than the speeches of Bourne and Gasquet are the Catholic Congress’s proclamations of sympathy with the Irish: “Ireland is mired in difficult battle and is bleeding at the present moment.  May Ireland know that we bear its sufferings in our hearts.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“World Review” by Dr. Otto Kunze, Munich

<p>The entire conduct of nations and governments today is essentially determined by their position on Bolshevism. Like the Masque of the Red Death in Poe’s horror story, it goes around in the palace of culture. The guests draw their swords against the foreign intruder, but what they pierce is an empty shell.  The Red Death takes possession of their members and carries them off. Russia brings Bolshevism into all the world, but is perhaps already going about under its mask. Whoever lets it in, falls to the Red Death.   The nations of the West conduct themselves variously. Germany is struggling with difficulty against the sickness and lies in dangerous crisis. Italy appears for the moment to have overcome a heavy onset.  England acts against the infection and its symptoms in its own body somewhat frivolously. France reacts with the ardor of a healthy but sensitive body. America keeps its distance. It feels only the breath of the infection and remains strong enough to defend against it...

<p>Germany can defend itself against external Bolshevism, now as before, only by strict neutrality in the Russian-Polish War. The Reich Government is publicly holding fast to this policy and thereby deserves every support and, if needed, reinforcement. On the other hand, in the fight against domestic Bolshevism, unfortunately no longer is everything being done with the strengthening of governmental power in the Reich. The Spa dictate prevents the government from deploying its full power. The civil self-defense force must expand that power.  That is why it is very sad to see that the Orgesch, uniquely useful for this purpose, is being outlawed not only by individual local authorities, but by the Prussian Government. Naturally it is Herr Severing, the Interior Minister, the man of the Bielefeld agreement, who signs the prohibition. As a result the Orgesch is struck down in East Prussia, where Russians and Poles are at the gates, and as proof that it really is needed, a new self-defense force is founded, which because of the inclusion of politically dubious elements can be no defense against Bolshevism. Against the unlawful prohibition of the Orgesch, which is a registered association, Escherich has raised a strong protest in a letter to the Reich President. Also a legal complaint is being prepared. Saxony is likewise moving against the Orgesch and, incredibly, so is Württemberg. The Reich itself will now have to show whether it really has a civic bourgeois government.

<p>... The proposed Zionist State “Jerusalem” would be considered not as a place of national gathering, but rather as the base of the central committee for Jewish World-Power-Plans [<em>Weltmachtpläne</em>] of exploitation and fraud.  An independent state for those whose real home is to be found elsewhere.  A fortress in which to secure the booty.  Karl Marx, the founder of the Red International, was the conscious underminer of the social concept.  To be a social being means to work for the common good.  Marx preached class struggle, incited brother against brother, instead of reconciling social principles...  The poorer a people, the more the Jew has them in his power.  Look at Soviet Russia.  Trotsky, Lenin, Sobelsohn, 3 Jews and today?  14-hour workday and the scourge of hunger.  The Jew wants to generally have rights under the law, but not duties.  If you remind him of his duties, he cries “Antisemitism.”  The left-wing leaders of the workers are Jews or in the pay of Jews.  They have never worked and never will... The speaker rounded against an article of Wendelstein that tried to ride the coattails of the “Free from Rome Movement” by alluding to a very clear appeal out of German Austria.  The Party stands on the basis of Positive Christianity and all Christian activity as the foundation of authority.  That means the organized struggle of the broad masses against their oppressors, the blood-sucking vampire, International Jewry of the “Alliance Israélite” and Freemasonry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The time is past when, for reasons of convenience, one must hold back inside oneself the criticisms that one is tempted to formulate.

Polish-Lithuanian questions. - 5. Ukrainians and Poles. - 6. Poland’s political program. - 7. Soviet imperialist policy. - 8. The social goals of Bolshevism. - 9. The magnificent Polish counter-offensive.

<p>I do not know which French writer of the 18th century said there is a simple and infallible way to make a falsehood look like truth, but it is repeated hundreds of times.  This maxim has been very widely applied during the war years and peace negotiations to bolster so-called propaganda.  Also recently a newspaper in Rome, writing about the Pontiff’s plea in favor of Poland, repeated as indisputable truth the idea that an attack by Poland was the cause of the Bolshevik war.  Now, before pronouncing a judgment, it is necessary to examine the factual circumstances that gave rise to the Russian-Polish conflict.

<p>1. The Treaty of Versailles recognized a free and independent Poland but did not properly create a Polish State.  To create a State it is necessary, first of all, to give it boundaries, and it is even more necessary when, as in the case of Poland, the State does not have natural geographic boundaries.

<p>The Allied Supreme Council failed to determine the boundaries of the Polish State, either in the east, or in the west, or in the north, except for a the small part along the Baltic coast and Pomerania.  In the west and south, the decision was turned over to four referendum votes, one of which, for the region of Teschen, posed a choice as against Czechoslovakia, and the other three, Upper Silesia, Marienwerder and Allenstein, posed a choice as against Germany.  
<p>Now four referendums represent four vast fields of battle that aggravate exasperations and inflame the contending passions of the opposing peoples.  Added to this were the results of the referendums, which were not done in the course of normal conditions in the life of the people, arousing enormous resentment over the changes from one political order to another. Moreover, in the events pertaining to Marienwerder and Allenstein, the referendum took place in the days when the Bolshevik tide swept upon Poland.  Then in the east, not only did the Treaty of Versailles fail to determine boundaries, but it established nothing internally within these vast territories of mixed populations.

<p>2. Immediately after the Armistice, Poland found itself in extremely grave circumstances.  Already in November 1918, that is in the week preceding the Armistice, its territories became the bridge of passage for the remnants of the stricken armies of Austria and Hungary that were returning from the Italian front in Galicia, as well as Germans being repatriated from the front lines on the Russian Front and Russians who were returning to their country.  In the middle of this disorder the Ukrainians on the one hand attacked the Poles around Lvov in eastern Galicia, and on the other hand in the west, the Czechoslovaks were seeking to establish possession of the Teschen part of Silesia.

<p>As if that were not enough, the Bolshevik wave was aiming to break upon Poland.  In October 1918 there were still German troops on Polish territory, and there was serious difficulty in disarming them and forcing them to leave Poland. The Polish leadership elements, divided into action committees that worked in full accord with the governments of the Allies, had not yet returned to Poland, but were still in foreign capitals.  Thus it could be said without exaggeration that Poland had been the country worst flagellated by the War, but was also the one that received the most harm in the wake of the Armistice, while the population was shattered and exhausted by the sacrifices they were still enduring.

<p>In November 1918 Marshal Pilsudski, who is today the head of the Republic of Poland, had just been released from Magdeburg Prison, where the Germans had confined him in 1917, and by the will of the people he assumed the highest office, which could only be sustained in such serious circumstances by the full strength and energy of such a man.

<p>Meanwhile on all the borders of Poland threats from neighboring peoples were felt, as the Poles had a small army of 50,000 soldiers, short on gear and provisions, in the face of enemies who could put in the field forces of ten to twenty times that size.

<p>At Versailles there were such serious problems to resolve that the Allied Powers could not turn their attention to events developing in Poland and were content to rely on commissions.  Finally, starting from Italy, help began to arrive in the form of “medical supplies,” weapons and ammunition, in January 1919.

<p>These were the conditions in which Poland began its work of political reconstruction.  Its patriotism and concord seemed like a miracle, as everyone who was involved in this work in Poland in 1919 was unanimous in admiring the results attained in an extremely short time by the superhuman accomplishment of an entire people.

<p>3.  To liberate eastern Galicia and its capital of Lvov from the Ukrainian menace, the Poles had to provide for their defense in the territories of Grodno, Vilno and Minsk, which have mixed populations, in which however the Catholic Poles were the leading elements, for reason of numbers, culture and economic considerations. The Bolshevik peril was not at all dispelled, though it was rather far off during the first movements of the Polish Army, which advanced and grew larger and organized for this work all the legions that were created and formed as in France and Italy, where volunteers and Polish ex-prisoners of war streamed forth under the banner of the nation.

<p>The Paris Conference, as we have already said, had not defined the boundaries of Poland in the east, but had allowed full freedom to the Poles to develop their own actions in the territories that separated Russia from Poland proper, “expressly reserving the rights of Poland to assess its territories itself.”  These territories in fact were the cause of all the discord between Poland and Russia...

<p>4.  It is noted that Lithuania was united with Poland toward the end of the 14th century to defend against the Teutonic Knights ... This union was maintained up until the dismemberment of Poland...

<p>But Lithuania in the historical sense does not correspond with Lithuania in the ethnographic sense, populated by Lithuanians properly so called (around 2 million), with minorities of Poles and Jews, occupying the northern part of the province of Suwalki, part of the province of Vilno, and the whole province of Kovno, which was entirely Lithuanian in character.

<p>The White Ruthenians, which are divided two groups, western and eastern ...

<p>The Poles, in the two years following the Armistice, tried in every way to arrive at an accord with the Lithuanians on a basis of full independence for ethnic Lithuanians. The bone of contention, however, was always the possession of the city of Vilno, the capital of historic Lithuania, which is inhabited however, by an overwhelming majority of Poles, with a minimal percentage of Lithuanians.  The same thing can be said of the surrounding district, in which Poles are also the majority.  In order to possess Vilno, the Lithuanians concluded an alliance with the Bolsheviks; but the Bolsheviks, after the Polish retreat, occupied Vilno and would not hand it over to the Lithuanians.  The goal of the Bolsheviks is obvious: they want to “Bolshevize” Lithuania.  Thus, between the two contending parties, Poles and Lithuanians, a third has intervened, who has reaped the harvest of their quarrel. Is it not, therefore, time to put an end to a vain competition, in the interests of both parties, and to join in a united work for the salvation of both countries and of Catholicism menaced by Bolshevism?  The Lithuanians should stop hesitating over which state they choose to make an accord with.  This is a matter of their very existence, which the Bolsheviks have shown they have no disposition to respect.  Despite all the disappointments felt by the Poles in their relations with Lithuania, the Polish Government is always disposed to arrive at an agreement.

<p>5. The conflict between the Poles and the Ukrainians was even more serious.  But it is no less true, as events have shown, that it also could be resolved.  Indeed it seemed that the problem was in the course of being solved, but the solution itself has been the cause of the recent Bolshevik invasion of Poland.  Because, in fact, the Poles, in their professed idea for such a solution, accidentally found themselves coming up against the Russian-Bolshevik program.  But let us first look at some facts.

<p>The main area of disagreement between the Poles and Ukrainians is so-called eastern Galicia… The cities of eastern Galicia, in general, are Polish.  The Dniester River divides eastern Galicia into two zones: the mixed Polish-Ruthenian, north of the Dniester, where the two ethnic groups are equal in numbers (and where the Poles have their great national center in Lvov) and that of Ruthenian Ukraine south of the Dniester, where the Polish minority approaches 29 percent.

<p>Therefore it cannot be said that Lvov is a Polish island in a Ruthenian sea, or that it is similar to an English Ulster in Catholic Ireland.  Rather than a matter of an island, it is an inter-population of ethnic groups living together in free association for centuries.

<p>From the historic point of view, the older Russian historians such as Nestor affirmed that the Polish population of eastern Galicia was native to the area and were not immigrants; from the intellectual and cultural point of view, eastern Galicia owes everything to Poland.
<p>Economically, the Poles, when Galicia was part of Austria, paid taxes in all regions at 81.7 per cent and in eastern Galicia the percentage concerning Poles was 73.8…

<p>In 1918, it must be recalled, the Polish population of eastern Galicia showed itself to have a national consciousness, numerous, strong in energy, without ulterior motive, to defend against the pressures from the Ukrainians coming from Ukraine proper.

<p>The Allied Supreme Council, leaving the administration of the entire zone to the Poles, intended to guarantee autonomy to the Ukrainians on the basis of a special statute.  This sort of mandate for the Poles, entrusted by the Council for 25 years, was made by a decision of the same Council on December 25, 1919 and suspended indefinitely in favor of Poland: everything that happened was motivated by the national and economic importance of eastern Galicia for Poland, and also in view of the sacrifices that the Poles had to make in favor of Ukraine, in the territory of Podolia and Ukraine proper, because outside the borders of eastern Galicia, the Polish element is scattered in Ukrainian territory, where it constitutes a small minority, which represents, however, an intellectual and economic force of the first order.  Suffice to say that in Ukraine, in addition to owning great properties, the Poles are at the head of important commercial and industrial enterprises, which employ a large number of people and touch upon a number of extremely important interests of incalculable value, embracing not only owners but also industrial specialists, professionals, workers and farmers.  Polish properties in Ukraine amount to 25 million square kilometers.

<p>This mixture of one people with another is explained by the facts of five centuries of shared history.  The Polish-Ukrainian problem thus cannot be resolved other than by reciprocal sacrifices and concessions.  A solution was not possible while Ukrainians and Poles were under Austrian rule, which had every interest in keeping them enemies and adversaries of each other, but once they had become the masters of their own destiny, they had a common interest in coming to an understanding.

<p>In fact, as to the conflict over Lvov, the Polish-Ukrainian negotiations lasted about a year and a half, and three proposals were advanced to establish the borders between Ukraine and the Polish State, and it is clear that two of these, agreed by the Ukrainians, included eastern Galicia within the borders of the Polish State.  Thus a Polish-Ukrainian agreement was reached on April 25, 1920, concluded between General Petliura and the Polish Supreme Command.  This agreement had as its foundation the assistance that the Poles offered to Petliura’s government against the Bolsheviks.

<p>6.  Between Poland and Russia a series of independent States arose, masters of their own destiny.  To this end, the Poles proposed that these territories be vacated by the armies, Russian and Polish alike, to assure the population the freedom to express their will.

<p>This program was in contrast to the Soviet Government’s program of centralization and absorption, but this should not have offended them if the principles of independence they proclaimed for the people had been sincere.

<p>In addition to that, the Soviet Government itself, after the Brest-Litovsk Agreement and before the victory of the Allies caused the collapse of the Central Powers, officially denounced to Austria and Germany the treaties concerning the partition of Poland.  By this denunciation, Russia was automatically brought back to the frontier lines that marked the boundaries of Poland in 1772.  What reasons could the resurrected Polish nation have had to feel limited in its right to make agreements with its neighbors!

<p>The Allies, having set Poland’s boundaries only in the west, left it free in its movements and encouraged it with demonstrations of sympathy.  Such encouragements coincided with the economic interests of all of Europe, because while the imports that could come from Bolshevik Russia were rather problematic, it would have been more convenient to receive them from an economically restored Ukraine for the benefit of the entire West.  Thus it was in Europe’s best interests that these lands, which were subjected to Bolshevik misgovernment, should be liberated and become a source of common good.  So it was not a spirit of imperialism that drove the Poles to help neighboring peoples against Bolshevik barbarism, but rather their traditional policy of conciliation and mutual recognition of freedom.

<p>Nevertheless this program was the spark that ignited the explosion of Soviet militaristic policy.  It was a miscalculation by the Poles to trust in a mainly idealistic policy, or in the cooperation of the Ukrainian people, because it appears now that Petliura’s prestige among the Ukrainian people was not such as to assure the success of the enterprise, but it cannot be denied that it was a noble effort.

<p>7.  On the other hand, the Polish offensive in the Ukraine was related to the military preparations of Bolshevik Russia.  The Bolsheviks, as illustrated by events today, did not want to give up their active propaganda for Bolshevism in Poland and in western countries accessed through Poland.  That should be strongly emphasized, because it was certainly not the Polish Government’s choice of Borysow as the place of negotiations that caused the Soviets’ refusal to arrive at a peace agreement, but rather the desire to gain time in order to push forward their military preparations and hurl upon Poland the masses summoned up from Asia to impose a Soviet regime.  Poland therefore, partly out of the necessity of the historical moment, driven by the Bolshevik menace, and partly also because prompted by the Allies, was forced to pursue war, in order to be placed on a path of alliances with the neighboring nationalities and States situated between Russia and the Polish State, confident of gaining those territories for civilization and for the European economy and at the same time protecting itself from Bolshevism.

<p>This seemed the only way to force Russia to a lasting peace.  But once Poland was basically engaged in this policy, Britain changed course and opened peace negotiations with the Bolsheviks to relieve their pressure on India, and France continued to encourage Poland in the undertaking.

<p>Only at the last moment, the French State, taking account of the logistical difficulties and especially the lack of munitions, counseled against the march on Kiev, while the Polish State, informed of the military preparations of the Bolsheviks, was of the opinion that there was no other way to derail the Russian offensive except by a move toward the Ukrainian capital.  The Poles responded to criticisms by saying if they had not attacked and if the Bolsheviks had taken the initiative from their original lines, the Bolsheviks would have immediately invaded all of Poland, while by means of the Polish advance, the threat against the Polish ethnic territories was kept at bay for some time.  Both theories are debatable, and it is not within our competence to render a judgment. What is certain is that events had taken for some time a disastrous turn for Poland, so that the Western Powers had only two paths to choose from: either impose a peace immediately at the time of the Spa Conference, when the danger was already manifest, or extend immediate and adequate aid to Poland.

<p>Instead the governments of Britain and France were caught up in futile battles of words, with diplomatic notes and telegrams, giving the Bolsheviks time to invade a Poland that was short on munitions.  Thus Poland was made a plaything for the Soviets, who could not want anything better.  But Poland, abandoned to her own devices, knew how to find in herself enough faith and enough strength to break the iron circle that was trying to choke her.

<p>8. The morals and political methods of the Bolsheviks are well-known today.  The negotiations for the Armistice and the peace negotiations placed them again on display.  The Bolsheviks had no intention of renouncing active propaganda for Bolshevism in Poland and in the rest of Europe through Poland.  Bolshevism pursues two goals, the conquest of political territory and moral conquest.  The first is nothing other than the pursuit of the former program of the Czarist schismatics, to gain control of all Slavic territory; the other, even more dangerous, goes beyond racial boundaries and strives to upset the foundations of Christian society and the family, overwhelming European peoples with the darkness of atheism and moral misery.  It pretends to take up the defense of the people, and instead, with diabolical artifice, drives them onto the path to perdition of the soul and perdition of material well-being.  Where Bolshevism passes by, there remains misery and famine.

<p>This is how the Polish Bishops expressed themselves about Bolshevism in their letter to the Bishops of the entire world, published in the month of July.

<blockquote>We are not fighting against the Russian nation, but against those who have trampled Russia and sucked their blood while dragging souls down in new conquests.  Just as locusts, after destroying every sign of life in a place, fly off elsewhere, driven on for further works of destruction, so Bolshevism, having poisoned and plundered Russia, turns its design to Poland. Our spirits do not fail because we know the vitality of our nation, because we trust firmly in Divine Providence, but we feel completely isolated in this grave hour.

<p>Here at this moment we lift our voice to you, our venerable brother bishops, with the strong desire that this letter be disseminated throughout the world.

<p>And the threats of today are not against us alone.  For the enemy that fights us, Poland is not in fact the final goal of their conquests: Poland is only the first stage and the bridge for the conquest of the world.

<p>And this is not in fact too strong a word about the conquest of the world that we send to you.

<p>Whoever knows how Bolshevism has also enveloped Nations more distant from Russia with a network of propaganda and intrigues; whoever knows how the Communist International is spread out through the world and even in governments, whoever knows the psychology of the people who direct this entire network of conspiracy, and whoever knows their methods, their teachings and their goals, such persons will understand and appreciate our words. 

<p>All that Bolshevism proclaims, speaking of the people, of the destiny of the worker masses, of freedom, and of the dictatorship of the proletariat, all this teaching masks their hidden real goals from the eyes of the uninformed.

<p>Today everything has already been prepared for the conquest of the world.  The organized forces in every country are only awaiting the signal to begin the battle; first and foremost, strikes are being continually planned to paralyze the organic life of the nations.  The class struggle is being transformed into a paroxysm of hate, and with their international influence they are effectively able to impede any healthy reaction of public opinion and national self-defense.

<p>Poland stands as the last bulwark preventing the triumphal march of Bolshevism, and if this bulwark is breached the destructive waves will sweep over the entire world.

<p>These waves that threaten the world today instill real terror, because Bolshevism is the flowering of all the negative principles that were festering over the last century in the lower level of life and that attack the family, education, the social order and even science, which until recently was idolized.

<p>Bolshevism has only added action to these doctrines: it puts its principles into action by means of murder, bloodshed, dictatorship, and the despotism of a single personality.  Along with doctrine and action, Bolshevism bears in its bosom a heart full of hate.  Its hatred is directed first of all against Christianity, of which it is the very negation: it is directed against the cross of Christ and against his Church.  

<p>We intend to speak in general of Europe and the modern world.  For if the world wants to remain indifferent to the fate of the Church, of supernatural life, and of the Christian spirit, it still could not look with indifference upon the annihilation that threatens its own civilization, which was born from Christianity.

<p>That is why we turn to you, our brother bishops, with a plea for help.  We are asking you neither for money, nor for munitions, nor for ranks of soldiers.  We are not asking for those because we do not want war, but only peace, so long as this peace will not be a new conquering of our country and threat to the world.  We want peace, peace is what we implore, and therefore what we ask of you, venerable brothers, is the arm of peace, and that is prayer.

<p>More than once the Catholic world has prayed for our country, but when has the occasion ever been more distressing?  Prayer for Poland, venerable brothers, would multiply blessings for every Christian nation.  For thanks to prayer, the threatened Catholic world will form ranks in an army that takes up the battle against that terrible and so extraordinarily well organized enemy; prayer will reinforce the Christian spirit that will be manifested in the world by imploring souls, and that will be opposed to the ambitions of those who want to dominate the world.

<p>In truth, Bolshevism is the living incarnation and manifestation on earth of the spirit of the Antichrist.  This spirit betrays itself completely as it goes so far in its passionate desires for sacrilege upon the churches, the murder of priests, the merciless massacres of the Catholic population, and bestial torture and cruelty. Raising our voice today for Poland, we raise it for the whole world, and when we speak of ourselves, we speak at the same time for you also, brothers. At the end of the day, prayer carries with it divine mercy, it will awaken the conscience of the nations because this conscience, which had been awakened after the war, died again, and how quickly!  The echo has still not died away of the invocations declaring that Bolshevism menaces the peace of the world, that it conquers at the cost of bloodshed, that it is a plague that is destructive of all life, and that no State that wants to survive can establish relationships with it or negotiate with it.  The voice has still not died away that solemnly proclaimed this order of the day from governments and diplomats, and yet here Europe is beginning to bow at the feet of its relentless enemy.  Whereas until recently Europe rejected any negotiations with Bolshevism, rather isolating it like a district struck by the plague, here today Europe itself is striving to find a way to recognize for the Bolsheviks a right of citizenship among the nations.  Until now Europe stigmatized the spirit of Bolshevism as a harmful ferment for the world, and now it proclaims that for grain and for commerce it needs to free its conscience from a supposed hyper-sensibility.  At first the nations did not hold back money, nor sacrifices, to stop the Bolsheviks, while today they have become so bold that they dare to offer their gold to the Powers. Until just a short while ago, the nations were sending armies and munitions to conquer the Bolsheviks, yet here today, they look with a cold eye upon Poland, which is bleeding in a terrible struggle, thus giving the impression that certain States, instead of isolating the eastern plague by means of a powerful Poland, want to see it small and weak.

<p>We add these details without any intention of entering into politics: we summarize them only as the real manifestations of moral change in Europe and the world. In truth, Europe of a few months ago, and Europe of today, do not resemble each other. The former, by the principles it espoused, becomes the judge of present-day Europe.  May prayer lead souls to a deep remorse and fear: and with the resplendence of truth, may artificial sophistry be destroyed, and may the world be awakened to a new conscience and drawn to new spiritual forces.</blockquote>

<p>9.  The appeal of the Polish bishops, and the prayers lifted up to the Lord by all the Church at the invitation of the Pope, did not return void.  We have been able to be present this past week at a victory that is truly miraculous and that could surely never have occurred apart from the divine will.

<p>After they retreated more than four hundred kilometers under pressure from Bolshevik hordes advancing under their fluttering red flags; after the tired and nearly hopeless Polish armies were reduced to defending the walls of their capital, deprived of weapons and abandoned by the world; a strength suddenly descended upon them, and these same armies, with a sudden impulse, in the name of Christianity and their fatherland, lunged upon the enemy and put him to flight. All the bells of Warsaw greeted the miraculous victory and in all the churches thanks were returned to the Lord, who willed to save his faithful people and willed to give yet one more time a sign of his omnipotence.

<p>And the joy of the exultant hearts of the faithful was not the fierce joy of those who have taken down an opponent, but the deepest and sweetest joy of those who, though commiserating over the need for such great bloodshed, know that by this human sacrifice on the battlefield, Europe has been saved from the certain engulfment of its society in far more terrible and bloody massacres of civil war and the ruin of all that is healthy and moral in the world.

<p>These sentiments of Christian moderation, which inspired and pervaded Poland, appear now in the peace conditions proposed by Poland, and mainly in the first condition in which Poland proposes that negotiations be conducted on the principle that there be neither victors nor vanquished.

<p>This condition would be enough; it has long been preached and discussed but never put into action by any victorious people, and for this we should pay tribute to Poland, which is really demonstrating that their own political thought is informed by those principles set forth by our Holy Father, Benedict XV, during the long years of the most extreme travail of European life.  Poland has paid attention to His word and has promptly received, we are certain, the fruit of their Christian virtue.</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>The Key to the Puzzle.</strong> Dateline Zürich. We initially took the report of the Bolshevik-friendly position taken by the leaders of the Swiss Freemason lodge “Alpina” at the meeting of the Paris Great Orient lodge as hardly believable.  Because such direct propaganda by Swiss Freemasonry for Russian Bolshevism is rather extreme stuff.  But now we learn that the selfsame Isaak Reverchon is the current Grand Master of the Alpina, belongs to the highest 33rd grade of Freemasonry, and as a Jew is playing his role quite well.  Significantly, the highest positions in Freemasonry are almost entirely in Jewish hands, and today they are the ones who actually make policy. And this so remarkable policy toward Bolshevik Russia and its current Jewish powers that be, who are well known to belong, without exception, to Freemasonry, becomes really understandable if you look past the subterfuges of the Lodges.

<blockquote>“Zionism in Palestine” – by our special correspondent – dateline London, September (no date given)

<p>It appears that Britain and Greece have concluded agreements pursuant to which Venizelos has given orders to begin an offensive in Asia Minor.  Greece would have become the advance guard of Great Britain and the signing of such a reciprocal accord would have its effects especially in Palestine.

<p>A letter received from Jerusalem correspondent Roger Lambelin offers us a characteristic proof.

<p>The Prince of Israel – as the Jews of the Holy Land call him – the British High Commissioner, made his prayer on Saturday, July 24th at the Great Synagogue of the Ashkenazim, which is found within the dividing wall of the Jewish Quarter, adorned with carpets. 

<p>For the Commissioner it was a day of real triumph.

<p>On the evening before, Sir Herbert Samuel had gone to the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre and was solemnly received there.  The Greek Orthodox Patriarch accompanied the High Commissioner, who passed between two rows of Greek monks holding lighted candles.  The Holy Sepulchre and Calvary were illuminated and decorated.

<p>But, despite the strong insistence of the Greek Patriarch, Sir Samuel did not enter the Holy Sepulchre itself.

<p>This very strange visit provoked a serious incident among the Orthodox.  The same evening the Synod declared Patriarch Damianos deposed for complicity in Zionism.  But the attempt at unity remains there in all its gravity.

<p>In 1916 Palestine was internationalized, and Mr. Briand had been able to maintain, to the strong approbation of the parliamentary deputies, that the principle of internationalization would never be sacrificed, much less the influence of France.

<p>Nevertheless Article 95 of the Treaty of Versailles indeed provided for the application of a mandate also for Palestine, and provided this precisely to establish a national land for the Jews.

<p>The history of this is well-known.  And it was to a Jew that the British Government entrusted the custody of the Holy Land.

<p>“Lieutenant Jabotinsky”

<p>The statement of Lieutenant Jabotinsky is interesting, and it is well known that this officer, when Lord Allenby occupied Palestine, had constituted the famous Jewish Legion and precisely for that was prosecuted and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

<p>The press has mentioned a statement made by Sir Herbert in favor of this Lieutenant before leaving London...

<p>“An Authoritative Contrary Opinion”

<p>The Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem, Dr. Rennie MacInnes, recently gave a serious warning about the danger of Zionism.  It is noteworthy that this bishop is considered a broadminded man, not an alarmist, who is generally held in esteem and sympathy.

<p>According to statements he made upon the arrival of the High Commissioner, there were in Palestine 540,000 Muslims and 65,000 Christians.  He believes that at the first occasion of popular elections, the Christians and Muslims will all vote the same.

<p>According to Dr. MacInnes, few Jews of high rank have as yet come to Palestine.

<p>It is notable that a barbarian element from Russia, Poland and Romania, all of them openly Bolshevik,  have been nonetheless protected and supported by the Zionist Commission.

<p>Still according to the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, this immigration constitutes the gravest danger for the future well-being of Palestine.

<p>“The Agrarian Policy”

<p>At the London World Zionist Conference, it was decided to collect a sum of 25 million to carry out the project of Zionist expansion in Palestine.

<p>After the approval of this project, a serious debate arose over the basic lines of policy concerning Palestine.

<p>The principles that were adopted are the following:

<p> 1. Lands for Jewish settlement shall constitute property of the community as a whole.

<p>2. Administration is to be in the hands of the local Jewish council.

<p>3. Lands shall be worked only by Jewish laborers.

<p>4. The ultimate purpose of the agrarian policy will be the complete settlement of the land by Jews.

<p>Many believe that that Britain, despite having accepted the mandate, does not intend to retain possession of Palestine...

<p>The testimony of an American billionaire indicates the entire program of Zionism.  Occupation of territory, tactful expulsion of the Arabs, commonly held property administered by the Jewish community; enormous intellectual and technical development with global support.  All this to achieve the ultimate end result of placing all religions under the lowest Jewish common denominator.

<p>“Cardinal Dubois and Zionism”

<p>Dateline Paris, Oct. 7.  The <em>Petit Parisien</em> , which has published its interview with Cardinal Dubois, also contains interesting statements of the illustrious man of the Purple about the new regime in Palestine, where he visited not long ago, as we have reported.

<p>The status of the Holy Places, said Cardinal Dubois, does not yet appear resolved.  It disgusts me to think that a dissident Confession would be given custody of them.  This is an anomaly, one of those human imperfections to which we are accustomed.  St. Louis certainly could never foreseen this as he lay on his deathbed!

<p>Zionism?  And Britain appearing to promote it?  But who, among the Jews of this world – I mean to say those who have any influence – will go to place their riches at the door of the temple?  The Jews claim Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth! Which Jews?  Those who traffic between the colonies and who are hunted at a crack of the whip?  Or the poor farmers, or lazy shepherds, or clever brokers?  Are these the ones that Zionism wants to summon to Palestine?  To do what?  Zionism does not appear to be a thing of misery; I say this without rancor. But who knows? For believers, the designs of Providence are inscrutable. The Holy Places were abandoned for a long time to a sad and unfortunate maltreatment. Who knows that a higher design did not allow nations other than ours to prepare them to be later returned to their former glory, to the Catholic peoples?</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“A Peril”

<p>The foreign press, and especially that of France, has taken up what has been called the Jewish peril.

<p> <em>La Croix</em> and <em>L’Action Française</em> have raised their voice: One with a compelling article by Mr. Vuigent, the other with an interesting piece on the Jewish power in England and the Alliance Israélite.

<p><strong>Opportune Distinctions</strong>

<p><em>La Croix</em> says that the considerable role played by the Jews in the Bolshevik Revolution, of which they were the leaders, the posts that the Jews hold in the political and financial congresses, the relations they have with official personages everywhere for gaining favors, especially with what has been set up in Palestine by the British Government, all of this powerfully attracts attention to the Jewish peril that seems to be overlooked in the face of the alleged German peril.

<p>One must immediately distinguish between Jew and Jew, just as in a similar analysis we would want to distinguish between Christian and Christian.  It is indeed too easy to generalize and represent the Jewish race as immoral and incapable of good...

<p>In reality, it must be mentioned that there are still individuals in the world from Jewish families who live in good faith in their centuries-old path, directing their sincere hearts to the true God. 

<p>But these are very few in number.

<p>In their immense majority, the Israelite people have passed from worship of the true God to worship of Satan ...

<p>The Jewish peril exists; and it needs to be understood in its hatred toward Christ and Christian peoples.

<p>What can seem surprising is that the attention of the public has been drawn to this peril by an English newspaper, the <em>Times</em>, whose relations with the Jewish world are well known.

<p><strong>Jewish Peril</strong>

<p>This past June the <em>Times</em> spoke to its readers of a book by Sergio Nilus, published in Russian in 1902 and in 1905, a translation of which came to be published in London under the title <em>Jewish Peril.</em>

<p>The author reproduced in this book the speeches given by a Jewish personality at the Zionist Congress of Basel in 1897, who espoused the clear religious and social policy of the Israelites.  Sergio Nilus spoke of having gotten this document from a woman who had gotten it from a Masonic dignitary.

<p>We read there of things that are actually not certain…

<p>The reader will judge for himself about these excerpts:

<p>... [four paragraphs of the <em>Protocols</em> are reprinted here]

<p>These are so clear that they do not need any commentary.

<p>What to think about this document?

<p>In our opinion its Jewish provenance remains doubtful, as it rests only on the testimony of Sergio Nilus.

<p><strong>Is It Possible?</strong>

<p> <em>La Croix</em> said it decided to question Abbot Meniglier about this, since he is something of an expert and well informed about Russian matters ...

<p>I do not remember, said Abbot Meniglier, “having read the book of Sergio Nilus, and thus I cannot guarantee the authenticity of the words that are attributed to him.  But these words have nothing extraordinary about them in my view…

<p>-- Do you believe that the Jews have a plan of revolution that was applied in Russia?

<p>Yes.  Nowhere else were the Jews as powerful as in the Czar’s Empire, where they had a magnificent field for experimenting. 

<p>-- You say they were powerful.  But how so?  Didn’t the law prohibit them from living in the interior of Russia?

<p>That is true.  The law permitted them to establish themselves only in Poland and in some outlier cities, such as Odessa, where there were 300,000 Israelites among 700,000 inhabitants.  But there were ways to get around the law.  Since the Russians had a shortage of doctors and pharmacists, the sons of Jewish merchants took degrees in medicine and pharmacy to go and practice these specialities in Kiev, in Moscow, in St. Petersburg and other places.  These degrees were actually like passports, and all these supposed doctors constantly and openly practiced commerce and speculation.

<p>-- But is it true that the Jews had established themselves enough to direct the Russian Revolution?

<p>I believe that they planned to bring about their dream, that is, to become the masters of Russia and the world at one blow.  In this regard my recollections are more precise.  I was in Odessa at the time of the visit by Kerensky, a Jew, as is known.  The Israelite population went delirious.  The Czar never encountered such enthusiasm when he was in power.  They were clamoring for our Kerensky.  They believed that with him the kingdom of Israel would be installed in Holy Russia.  A Jew in front of me said to an Orthodox woman, we will take your churches and turn them into theater halls and stables.

<p>-- Do you believe, therefore, that the Jews have actually established the reorganizational plan that is attributed to them by the author of <em>The Jewish Peril</em>?

<p><strong>Fiction and Reality</strong>

<p>I am convinced of that.  The novel that I alluded to, whose title I do not remember, sets forth precisely this plan.

<p>-- Do you know what sentiments motivated these personalities?

<p>For a vendetta, Israel had to get back at its oppressors by killing some and enslaving the others.

<p>-- And its oppressors were Russian?

<p>Yes … Russia had, no doubt, committed wrongs toward them, but one must recognize that the vendetta has far surpassed the measure of the offense.

<p>-- Can you give us some news of the massacres organized by the Jews in Russia?

<p>You can read what is published about Russia today.  Reports from that country have already informed us and it is not surprising to learn that the victims of Bolshevik Judaism mounted to a hundred per day just in the city of Odessa.

<p>-- All these reports of Bolshevik horrors, are they not exaggerated?

<p>Certainly not.  The fact is that we only know parts of the reality.

<p>-- But all this is the result of passions of the moment and not rather the execution of a pre-made, concerted plan against the Christian world?

<p>As can be seen, these important statements of persons with such expertise in Russian matters produce a confirmation of Sergio Nilus.  It may well be that he invented the document: what remains beyond doubt is that the subversive ideas expressed there are exactly the same as what animated the Jews in Russia before the Bolshevik terror.

<p>The Jewish peril is not an empty phrase. 

<p>We do not deny that Satan is only a spirit and to conquer us he uses quite other things than cannons.  Only prayer can save from the Jewish peril.  But we need to join to it human means.

<p>That is all from the <em>La Croix</em>.

<p><strong>The Protocols of Zion</strong>

<p><em>L’Action Française</em>, pointing out that the Director of the <em>Morning Post</em> has put an interesting preface into the book <em>The Cause of World Unrest</em>, which contains articles appearing under that title in the newspaper over a three-month period, observes that an allusion is made there to the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, which has provoked such anger.

<p>The authors of this book, he writes, do not take care to guarantee the authenticity of all the reported documents, but what gives these documents a particularly noteworthy interest is that the Jewish Bolsheviks have carried out almost to the letter in Russia this program announced in the <em>Protocols</em>.

<p>The Hungarian Jews have tried, but with only ephemeral success, to apply the same methods.

<p>The action committees of the Labour Party, which are closely related to the Soviets, have set out on the same path.

<p>If one is willing to believe <em>The Hidden Hand</em>, the new title of the old <em>Jewry über Alles</em>, the Jews are not strangers to the strikes and threats of the British miners.

<p>Smillie, Williams and Thomas would only be puppets in the hands of Israel, which is pulling the strings.  It also seems that among the labor actions in the coal mines of Scotland, many of the miners are Polish Jews.  

<p>Smillie is only the spokesman for Emanuel Shingwell, a Jew from Glasgow, who was the main factor in all the labor conflicts in the Clyde region during the War.  Williams owes his authority to the fact that he has a Jewish wife, and Thomas is the damned soul of <em>Abraham</em>.  All three are in close relationship with the Lansbry-Fels-Zanwill group.”

<p>The Jewish peril is not a pipe dream, it is a tangible reality, even in England.

<p>The Jewish power, concludes the article, has left bloody tracks on the battlefields, in the devastated cities of eastern Europe, and it will further extend its evil activity if it continues to find complicity and support from government funds and labor organizations.

<p>From our standpoint it appears at any rate that the news of the day cannot avoid the importance of these writings.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“Zionism and Palestine: Serious Criticisms and Protests”

<p>It appears that Zionism is encountering unexpected obstacles on its path.

<p>Independent newspapers are not sparing in their criticism of the influence and works of Zionism in Palestine, in their news reports and commentaries.  And a singular echo of the state of mind arising in Palestine concerning Zionism comes to us in a speech by Cardinal Bourne at Church House in Westminster, in which he strongly deplored the administrative actions of the authorities in Palestine.

<p>He affirmed that after 1918 the Zionists manifested the most profound aversion to all the former inhabitants of the Land, including Jews.

<p>Not lacking among the immigrants were extremist provocateurs who proposed to destroy all the sacred vestiges of the Holy Places.  Sir Samuel certainly speaks otherwise, but he gives free reign of speech and action to the Zionist agents who are growing daily in their audacity and insolence.  The Russian, Polish and Romanian Jews are permeated with Bolshevik ideas; they presume that millions of men and rubles in Russia are only waiting for the opportune moment to pour again into Palestine...</blockquote><br>

<a name="93"></a><p><strong>Nov. 7, 1920</strong> <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em>, page one: “Zionism and Palestine” – dateline Paris, November 4

<p>The French press continues to cover with much interest the Zionist movement in Palestine, which it says is the result of British policy and the nationalistic activity of Governor Sir Samuel, whom the Jews of the Holy Land are now calling “The Prince of Israel.”

<p>The Governor indeed misses no occasion for showing openly the orientation of his actions toward the Zionist program, which has in him more than a guardian, defender and proponent: and this is now revealed by a series of events, including the public prayer on the Sabbath in the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem; the recognition of the Jewish Sabbath as a legal holiday in opposition to all the traditions of the indigenous population, of whom the Jews are only about a tenth part; the decree about the official languages, which contains systematic exclusions [of European languages]; and the freeing of Lieutenant Jabotinsky, head of the famous Jewish Legion.

<p>Such is the continuing discontent and disorder that the bonds of the opposition are growing ever stronger among the various races that have inhabited Palestine for centuries and that are feeling threatened, despite all the assurances, threatened with persecution, with ostracism, with exile.  Muslims and Christians of all denominations are ever more fervent anti-Zionists; and their issue is not so much religious or political, as it is a matter of life and death, since the tranquil possession of their goods and exercise of their civil rights are being threatened by an ever more powerful and intolerant Zionist organization under the protection of the Governor.

<p>A proof of this is the big incident that erupted among the Greek Orthodox.

<p>The Governor could not fail to visit the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre, and on that day the schismatic Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox rite, Damianos, encountered him and rendered him the honors due to his position, and was repaid immediately with a blunt refusal by Sir Samuel to set foot in the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, a refusal that was positively offensive and incomprehensible because it was in fact an obligation, whether he wanted it or not, for visitors to the Basilica. Damianos remained ill disposed, but others even worse, when several hours later his Synod dealt with the wrongdoings of the honors rendered to the effective head of Zionism in Palestine and the insult given in return.

<p>And meanwhile, between Jerusalem and London, Zionist action is active, tenacious, just as silent as it is skillful in developing relations and continuing its own program, so as to have the greater Israelite community believe that England will hold the mandate in Palestine until the time when Israel, attaining a majority, will be able to take over on its own account.

<p>There is a naiveté in this, in light of evidence that history itself is being ignored.  This does not lessen the fact that this hope is represented by Mr. Landmann, the Secretary General of the Zionist Association in London, and his most persuasive argument for organizing – as is being done – offices for immigration of Jews into Palestine, in all of Central Europe, in Galicia, in Poland, and at Trieste, the preferred place where the children of Israel should embark in this new Exodus to the promised land.  That is, those children of Israel whom the Promised Land has not already found.  And those are the majority.

<p>The <em>Stefani Agency</em> reports that Mr. Landmann came to Rome and was received together with Mr. Sullam, the representative of the Italian Zionist Federation, by the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs.  Which, the Agency correspondent  says, would have rather beat out the tune – as they say -  confirming to Mr. Landmann the interest and strong sympathy for the development of the Middle East on the part of Italy, which hopes that economic and cultural ties between Italy and Palestine will increase over time.</blockquote><br>

Russia is an agricultural state that can’t even feed itself so long as the Bolsheviks govern under the Jewish regime.  The Jew sits in Russia just as in Berlin and Vienna, and so long as the capital remains in the hands of this race, there can be no talk of buiding up, because the Jews have control of the international capitalists, who are likewise Jews, and they sell us Germans out...

<a name="93b"></a><p>First article: “The Catholics in Czechoslovakia”

<blockquote><em>The first part of this Dossier appeared in our edition of July 31, 1920 (pp. 83-96) under the title “Ecclesiastical Questions: 1st Those in Revolt; 2nd Attitude of the Holy See and the Bishops; 3rd Justifiable Reforms and Condemned Reforms”</em>

<p>Wanting to imitate Bismarck, President Masaryk and his government placed at risk the cohesion, the unity, and, consequently, the solidity of the new Czechoslovak Republic.

<p>The French public seems not to know about it  But, on the whole, what do they know about this country, other than its antique name of Bohemia and some aspects of its history?  The “big” press, for which silence is often golden, keeps quiet as it pleases about events that are unfolding there.

<p>Thus, “thanks to the falsification of history and information by liberalism, foreigners do not know the fact that an anti-religious minority terrorizes the majority of the Bohemian people, who, at the core, are still honest and Christian.”

<p>And nonetheless, one must take account, this tyranny of retrograde sectarians, copied with a bit too much ink from the <em>Kulturkampf</em> [“culture struggle” between Bismarck and the Catholic Church], and especially of the “French manner of forty years ago,” is shaking this young State that France contributing in creating.
<p>In anguish, the Bishops of Czechoslovakia, or more exactly of Bohemia and Moravia, in their eloquent Pastoral Letter of last September 18th, solemnly informed their faithful, and the echo of their voices should ring in the greatest number of French and Catholic ears.

<p>They publicly denounced the passivity and the complicity of the government in the attempts recently perpetrated yet again against the freedom of the Church, attempts that we have already identified:

<blockquote>Some apostate priests, having left the Catholic Church, and excommunicated by her, occupy in the ministries the posts of officials for matters concerning the same Church; they patronize the schismatic movement among the clergy and the people ...</blockquote>

<p>Threatened in their goods and their lives, Catholic priests unceasingly protest against this situation; they make appeals to the political and judicial authorities, even to the premier magistrate of the Republic, for the defense of their rights; but most often this is in vain.

<p>Concerning this intolerable situation of the Catholic Church, the Bishops of Bohemia and Moravia sent a memorandum to the President of the Republic and to the government.  In it they demanded religious freedom, guaranteed by natural law and by the Constitution of the State.  All the Bishops have repeated this appeal to law each time that this law has been grossly violated, giving the name of witnesses of these outrages.  But until now their voice has had no echo.

<p><strong>I - Bolshevism: Religious Anarchy Engenders Political and Social Anarchy</strong>

<p>The inevitable consequence: this systematic tolerance accorded by the government to anti-religious hatred finds its condemnation in the gruesome effects it engenders.

<blockquote>This is totally pure anarchy - continue the bishops.  A State that allows injury to natural law with impunity, to the guarantees of freedom of religion and of conscience in its Constitution and in the clauses of the international peace treaty, loses the consideration of the civilized world and all right to the title of an orderly State. (footnote: The Czechoslovak Catholics have indeed not forgotten Article 86 of the Treaty of Versailles nor Article 57 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain ...: “The Czechoslovak State accepts, in agreeing to the insertion into the treaty with the principal allied and associated powers, the provisions that the powers judge necessary to protect in Czechoslovakia the interst of inhabitants who differ from the majority of the population by race, language or religion.”... Yet who does not know that these general provisions have been taken principally in favor of Jews, without prejudice moreover to the special privileges assured to the Jews of Poland and specified in the “Letter of the President of the Peace Conference to Mr. Paderewski”?)

<p>In Slovakia, this anarchy has removed from the State all sympathies of the people and threatens the loss of this entire province.

<p>The government of the street and the influence of Masonic sects and free-thinkers allied to Bolshevism are working by violence and illegality to make us deviate from the wise principles that must preside over a politics that conforms to the requirements of law and liberty.</blockquote>

<p>In his Czech-Hussite patriotism, Masaryk commits a political fault when he seeks to tear away from his people the religious idea all the while claiming to recognize the importance of religious progress. He is fooling himself or seeking to fool us when he pretends that “the future of the State will be assured if schooling is conducted by the methods for forming good democrats and good republicans.”  Atheism can only develop egotism and thus ruin the most solid State, were it founded on a democratic and republican foundation.

<p>The Czech leaders forget that “every religious Luther inevitably has for a successor a political and social Luther,” and that “religious anarchy finally becomes political and social anarchy.”  Must they nonetheless forget this, while they are seeing the influence of the Bolshevik Muna, the Czechoslovak Lenin, set itself up against the turncoat Masaryk?

<p><strong>The Marxism of Masaryk</strong>

<p>In any case, a social catastrophe, if it is produced in Czechoslovakia, will surprise no one.  The “father” of the young State, hasn’t he insisted publicly upon his admiration for Marx, to whom Moscow-the-Red recently raised a statue? ...

<p><strong>The parties of the left adhere to the 3rd International</strong>

<p>... After having flirted with the Red Bolsheviks, tolerated the presence in Czechoslovakia of the sinister Bela Kun, the Bohemian Jew who brought about, for several weeks, the reign in Hungary of the most atrocious Red terror, allowed agitation by Alois Muna, the big ringleader of the Bolsheviks of Bohemia, the government of Masaryk has found itself in the presence of a political group that it must take seriously and “whose energy and power of expansion have been preparing sleepless nights.”  He has made an appeal to the agitators of the 3rd International to combat the Slovak nationalists, and “he has remained totally alarmed before the spirits that he has aroused himself.”

<p><strong>The Fall of Socialist Minister Tuschar</strong>

<p>The Socialist cabinet of Tuschar had to resign from power and hand it to the “business cabinet” of Tcherny.  Full of hatred to the end, the resigning government desired its last act to be the official recognition of a schismatic Church called: The National Czechoslovak Church.

<p><strong>The Victory of Poland Saves for the Time Being Czechoslovakia from Bolshevism</strong>

<p>This turn to the right that constituted the fall of the Socialist minister can be counted as an indirect victory of a Poland that was saved by Mary on the day of her Assumption, saved by France, which up to the present is an irreducible enemy of Bolshevik theories. The defeat of Poland was being counted on openly by Germany, secretly by Masaryk and Benes, his Minister of Foreign Affairs, these latter hoping to participate anew in the dividing up of Poland that the Cabinet in Berlin was preparing, supported by the Red armies and playing in 1920 the role of Austria in the 18th century...

<p>Fortunately victory, the friend of France, smiled upon Poland, and, under these circumstances, upon law and liberty: the Bolshevik peril was for the time being removed, as for a time the audacity of the Bohemian communists appeared broken and the German covetousness reined in again.</blockquote>

<p>Second article: “Separatism of Slovakia: Struggle Between Slovak Faith and Czech anti-Catholicism”

<blockquote>But the internal discussions, the opposition of a large part of the Czechs, and of the Catholic Czechs, to their own government, were not the only result of the Masonic blindness of the government: the Czechoslovak State is, furthermore, threatened by dismemberment, on the part of Slovakia, that is to say by a province of three million inhabitants.

<p>A correspondent of the <em>Temps</em>, faithful to the traditions of that house, thinks he must incense Masaryk and find his work admirable. He pretends that all efforts made to create among th Slovaks a national anti-Czech movement have failed.

<p>Now, an impartial personality, one who has seen, does not fear to state that

<blockquote>On the religious question as on many others, the disagreements are profound and grave within the country itself.  Between the two principal elements of the new nationality: Czechs and Slovaks, it is “opposition” that needs to be spoken.

<p>Invested by the Entente with political power - which they merited, moreover, it must be acknowledged, by their intellectual superiority - the Czech population is unfortunately, for the most part, imbued with the grossest anti-clericalism, while Slovakia remains profoundly faithful... From now on, the struggle is an open one between Slovak faith and Czech anti-Catholicism.  If the government commits the fault of aligning itself on the side of the latter, it will cause irremediable division of the country into two opposing parties, a division that is religion, but which, from now on, constitutes a danger of political separation.</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, hasn’t the Episcopate of Bohemia affirmed this straightforwardly?

<blockquote>In Slovakia, this anarchy has removed from the State all sympathies of the people and threatens the loss of this entire province.</blockquote>

<p>And this authorized warning, Monsignor Baudrillart made his own when, upon his return from Prague, he wrote:

<blockquote>If the persecution does not stop definitively, the Slovak people will finish by giving themselves to the Poles or rather will return to the Magyars, just as easily as the peace treaty left to the Slovaks a million Magyars, most of them educated and influential.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Slovak Demands</strong>

<p>Here are the <em>desiderata</em> that the Slovaks recently submitted to Mr. Micura, the Czech Minister for Slovakia:

<p>1. Slovakia must be governed independently from Prague.

<p>2. The official language used in Slovakia must be Slovak.

<p>3. Czech functionares must be allowed only in the event that Slovak functionaries are incapable.  Their appointments must be equal.

<p>4. Slovak schools with instruction in Slovak must be reopend.

<p>5. Places confiscated from the Slovak Church must be returned to it.

<p>6. Czech legionnaries must leave Slovak territories and the former borders of the Comitats must be maintained.

<p>7. Censorship must be abolished and political freedom assured to all.

<p>The memorandum claims that the famous pact signed in Pittsburgh (United States) on May 30, 1918 between the leaders of the Czech movement and the Slovak representatives assured Slovakia: an absolute autonomy, its own Parliament and separate tribunals. It bears the signatures of the two Slovak deputies, Abbés Juriga and Hlinka.

<p><strong>Abbés-Deputies Ferdinand Juriga and André Hlinka Leaders of the Movement for Slovak Autonomy</strong>

<p>The sentiments of Father Juriga, one of the five Slovak deputies in the Hungarian Parliament during the war, are sufficiently characterized by this ironic reflection on the subject of the Czechs: “History only knows one honest Czech, Saint John Nepomucene; even he was killed by the Czechs themselves.”

<p>As for Father Hlinka (or Glinka), the Curé of Ruzombersk, it appears his name must remain immortal in the history of Catholic Slovakia.  Zealous priest, ardent patriot, immense was the “action he has exercized by his works” since before the war.

<p>He created in his parish a publishing house where the newspaper <em>Slovak</em> was edited, and various other works: volumes of piety and scholarly manuals.  A studio and a bookstore complete the enterprise.  Associated with Messrs. Srobar and Houdek, who afterwards became ministers and his adversaries, Father Hlinka founded a bank in order to help his compatriots to “conquer economic independence and no long be subject to the good pleasure of Hungarian credit establishments.”

<p>He has since been shown to be emulated by his brothers, the Polish Canon Adamski, of Posnan, and Father Lucaciu, of Transylvania.

<p>Put in prison by the Hungarian Government, persecuted by his Bishop, a Magyar, against whom he had to appeal to Rome, Father Hlinka initially greeted the union of Slovakia and Bohemia with enthusiasm.  Soon, his infatuation with the Czechs was singularly rattled when Prague sought to “Czechize” Slovakia by oppression and religious persecutions.  Accompanied by Dr. Jehlichka, Father Hlinka went to Warsaw in September 1919 and succeeded in procuring Polish passports.  Arriving in Paris, the two Slovak patriots submitted to the Peace Conference a memorandum filled with the justified complaints of the Slovaks against the Czechs and demanding autonomy for their land.

<p>Prison, a Czech one this time, awaited Father Hlinka upon his return to Ruzombersk. As for Professor Jehlichka, he remained in Budapest.  Their activity, which was accused of being inspired by Hungary (footnote: On this subject, see <em>Osservatore Romano</em>, Feb. 23-24, 1920) and Poland, was not completely ineffective.  For a time, alas very brief, the Czech Government ameliorated its methods: it saw itself forced to have the “Sokols” brought back, to replace Czech soldiers with legionnaries; it even ordered soldiers to attend Holy Mass and recalled culpable Czech functionaries and employees.

<p>For his part, Father Hlinka explained his conduct in a letter sent from prison to Czech Deputy Mr. Myslivec, the editor of the <em>Cech</em>.  He had never wanted, he said, to betray the Republic, but what he did, he did for his beloved people, for religion and for the Slovak language.

<p>If his sentiments changed, if he was led to state “some reservations about the benefits of the Czechoslovak union,” the fault falls only upon the Czechs.  In any case, whatever point of view is taken for studying and judging the Czechoslovak question, this national hero does not appear to merit the insults of a certain press that comes to speak of his “puny ambition,” of his “fanaticism,” of his “bad faith toward his adversaries.”  If this Catholic priest is ambitious, his ambition is certainly not the sort for which the correspondent of the <em>Temps</em> reproaches him.

<p>Recently, indeed, Masaryk offered the leader of the Slovak Popular Party the Archepiscopal See of Olmutz (or Olomouc), which became vacant by the resignation of Cardinal Skrbenski-Hriste.  Now, Father Hlinka responded proudly “that he would prefer to remain Slovak in his curate position than to be Czech in the See of an Archbishopric.”

<p><strong>France Only Knows How to Accord Blind Trust in Czechoslovakia</strong>

<p>As we see, the Czechs will only be able to take this upon themselves if, at the end of the day, their national edifice collapses.

<p>We do not wish, let us hasten to say, that as Catholics, we would accept to be among those who “cannot forget that it is precisely the Czech nation that, by its categorical ‘never,’ condemned to dissolution the former conservative Austria.”

<p>Nor can we forget that “the Protestant Peace” of the Treaty of Saint-Germain has “spared Protestant Germany, dismembered Catholic Austria-Hungary, submitted the Slovaks (Catholics) to the Czechs (Hussites) and the Croats (Catholics) to the Serbs (schismatics), thus accusing its fundamentally anti-Catholic spirit.”

<p>Moreover, they like to constantly contrast “monarchical and Catholic” Austria, the enemy of France, with “democratic and Hussite” Czechoslovakia, the ally of the Entente.

<p>But, after all, can’t the question be asked, who were these men of State who were masters of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and inspirers of the enslaving policy of the German Empire?

<p>Do you want - a remark made in the Senate on June 30, 1920 Mr. Imbart de la Tour, reporter for the Treaty of Saint-Germain with Austria - me to indicate to you the Ministers of Foreign Affairs who succeeded each other in Vienna in the years that preceded the war? ...

<p>Is it not necessary that the proverbial generosity of France be tempered by a bit of defiance? Do we not indeed have the right, we, Frenchmen, to suspect the complicated maneuvers of Mr. Benes, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Czechoslovakia, maneuvers from which emerge the “Little Entente,” which a Parisian newspaper - not one of ours - calls the “Little Treason”?

<p>The Little Entente is first and foremost <em>pro-German</em>...

<p>Mr. Benes impatiently awaited the fall of Warsaw to divide up with Lenin the spoils of Poland, and, certain of the victory of that man holding a knife between his teeth, he boasted that <em>the Czechoslovak nation will not budge even if the Soviets are installed in Warsaw.</em> Mr. Benes had the imprudence to use similar language even at the moment when a Bolshevik victory was threatening the existence of the Treaty of Versailles; he was encouraging the Germans in all their aggressions against France, even encouraging them to refuse to pay the reparations upon which a large measure of the future of France depends, at the moment when Mr. Millerand and Marshal Foch risked everything to save Poland and prevent the cataclysm that menaced Europe...

<p>Anti-French, anti-Polish, pro-German and pro-Bolshevik, the policy of the Little Entente is still directed against Hungary, this same Hungary that has faithfully fulfilled all the commitments it has taken toward France ...

<p>Mgr. Baudrillart has the conviction - or might it be only a desire? - that “the Little Entente is definitively oriented toward France without looking any longer toward Germany.”...

<p>But as great as our desire may be to attach to our cause these new-born States that owe us in great part for their existence, we cannot accord them, especially not Czechoslovakia, blind trust.

<p>Mr. Bainville, with his exalted competence in foreign politics, has advised us:

<p>Czechoslovakia unites within itself too many diverse peoples and “does not represent today either an ethnographic unity, nor a historical, geographic or economic unity... The Czechoslovak State, in the opinion of true Czech patriots, is destined to collapse sooner or later...”

<p>Can we not sense, moreover, what great fear for the future is expressed by this exclamation from the principal Catholic daily paper <em>Tchèque</em>, writing in the aftermath of a series of outrages inflicted on the Church: “Do we need to appeal about this to the President, to the Government, to the authorities? That would be totally pointless! But we fear for the existence of the Republic! What is happening within it is in fact a den of robbers.”</blockquote>

   <p>At the beginning of March 1919, Petliura’s Ukrainian army left Vinnitsa, and the city found itself undefended.  Thus there was a sort of interregnum, during which criminals lorded it over us.  The Jews, anticipating the approach of the Bolsheviks, their allies, showed unheard of arrogance.  United in bands of brigands, they attacked houses, robbed, looted, and killed those who offered them the least resistance...

   <p>I was then in the dining room with my mother and some acquaintances who had come to visit.  Suddenly, the door of the adjoining room was thrown open violently and I saw a Jew, an ugly mug of the worst kind, savage-looking, frightful, with a revolver in his hand, then a second, a third, and all the others. At this sight, I got to my feet, but a gesture of his armed hand made me sit down.  It was intimated we were not to move, not to cry out, and one of the brigands, aiming his pistol at us, stood guard.
 
  <p>Meanwhile, another, short and stocky, appeared in the doorway, his face masked, and two black eyes could be seen darting sinisterly behind the mask.  Extending his arm toward my mother and me, he pointed to his companions who were there.  The greater part of these brigands were Jews and the band was led by them...

   <p>At one point, the Jewish head of the group led me into the next room and said to me in Russian: “Do you love life?  If you do, give me immediately all your valuables, otherwise...“

<p>2. The First Invasion of Bolshevik Soldiers

   <p>At Noon on March 18 the Bolsheviks entered Vinnitsa!  Many of those who had not yet seen Bolshevism up close hoped that with their arrival things would change for the better, thinking that an authority of whatever type is preferable to an absence of all power.

   <p>How bitterly disillusioned they must have been!

   <p>The entry of the Bolsheviks was greeted with enthusiasm by the Jews; and the first act of the new bosses was to arm them to the teeth.

   <p>Then the freshest blokes were seen strutting through the streets, awful ugly mugs, true refuse of society, armed with carbines, pistols, bombs, their mouths issuing arias of defiance and triumph.

   <p>Led by guides, just a few hours later, the Bolsheviks began a real manhunt for every Ukrainian who was left in the city.

   <p>Without trials and without any way of escape, all those who were suspected in any way were shot.  This first act gave the answer to the poor optimists as to what there was to expect from the new supremacy...

   <p>Several days passed in a certain calm.  Then, here again, some cars stopped in front of our house: a handful of soldiers, led by a Jew, were coming to load some furniture from the house and take it away quietly.  Unfortunately we were powerless in the face of such a violation of all law and needed to constrain ourselves to keep quiet.
 
  <p>After this event, we had a few weeks of tranquility, and we began to become accustomed to the hardships of our new abode, much preferable to the life together with the soldiers. (To be continued)</blockquote>

<p>The second article in the series, published in the December 4, 1920 issue, vol. 4, pp. 477-480, begins as follows:

<blockquote>1. A fierce Jewish Bolshevik Commissar.

   <p>One night, violent knocks at the kitchen door woke us up with a start.

  <p> It opens and in walks a certain “Towarysz Tomin,” pseudonym Circasso, in reality a Jew, the most out-and-out lowlife, capable of any extreme.  What a way to wake up!  He being the representative of the “Czerezwyczajka” (Extraordinary Commission), which is the highest Bolshevik authority, there was no one to turn to for help…

<p>2. Robbery and slaughter by the Bolsheviks ...</blockquote>

<p>The third and final article in the series, published in the December 18, 1920 issue, vol. 4, pp. 564-568, features the following headings among others:

<blockquote>6. The Red Terror.

<p>7. Persecution against the clergy.

<p>8. Horrors of Bolshevik prisons.</blockquote>

<p>The third article also contains this passage:

<p>   A friend of ours, young M.M., was arrested with his father.  One night he was led away to prison together with other companions, to be sent to a more commodious prison; the father, a short time after, was transported to Kiev.  The unhappy mother was not able to learn anything about her son, despite all her efforts.  After the departure of the Bolsheviks, his body, in an advanced state of decomposition, was found among those who were disinterred in the forest: his identity was ascertained by means of a medal he wore around his neck.  A soldier who was witness to his death recounted that, when the youth was condemned to death, all the Christian soldiers, touched by his youth and his noble features, refused to shoot.  Unfortunately there was a Jew among them who volunteered for that barbarous task.  With him, ten companions were also shot, and later, we learned that the father of the youth had also met the same fate in Kiev, at the moment when the Bolsheviks had to leave the city.  I am mentioning only some of those who were criminally dealt with.  The number was enormous in proportion to the small city...

<p>9. Liberation.  Traces of unheard of cruelty.

<p>I believe that these particular horrors should be known to everyone, but especially to those who still harbor any illusions about Bolshevism and Bolsheviks as “benefactors of humanity.”  This will bring advantage from the harsh experience of our city of Vinnitsa and will be at least an attempt to put into action the force to liberate the fatherland from the most terrible plague that has tortured humanity in centuries.
<p>A resident of Vinnitsa.
<p>October 1919.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>“A Pointed Warning to the Jews”

   <p>The arrogance of Jewish writers in the defamation of the Catholic Church and Christianity has so increased everywhere, that even those newspapers inclined to be extremely reserved toward the Jewish question are no longer maintaining their silence.  Thus the Jesuit-published <em>Stimmen der Zeit</em> [Voices of the Day] writes about the defamation of Catholic rectories and Catholic priests by Jewish theater directors and writers, as follows:  “Just in passing, we would like to give these Jewish theater directors and critics, who are defaming Catholic priests and thereby all Catholic people in the most unrestrained and shameful way, something to think about.  The anger of the entire Catholic people against the Jews has increased frightfully for many reasons (swindling, usury, Bolshevism).  Fever is approaching paroxysm, and already on many occasions it has been precisely the rectory taking great effort to restrain powerful riots.  It is going beyond material harm to the Catholic people, that is, to involve attacks and contempt toward their most holy sentiments, and these holy sentiments pertain also to the Catholic rectory, from which so much comfort, help and blessing flows to the people.  There can arise such heightened tensions that the word of the Catholic priest is no longer followed, so that the embittered anger of the crowd breaks loose.  Then may the Jewish theater people and writers account for the consequences.  They themselves will have brought it on.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Zionism and the Bolshevik Danger”

<p>The example of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem has now been followed by the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem in a public statement against the dangers of Zionism in Palestine. Up to now only a few Jewish notables have come to Palestine; most of the immigrants supported by the Zionist Committee have been Russian, Polish and Romanian Bolsheviks, who present deplorable prospects for the future wellbeing of Palestine.  According to view of Dr. MacInnes [the Anglican Bishop], the 540,000 Muslims and the 65,000 Christians in Palestine will vote the same way in a referendum concerning the Jewish element.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“French Freemasonry”
   
<p>Catholic France provides continual evidence of the decisive role that Freemasonry plays in the political and religious realm.  The clergy, which long underestimated the importance of the destructive efforts of this secret society, now sees clearly and shows itself committed to strong defensive measures as in the past against hypocritical creations of certain elements that stand totally in the service of Jewish Freemasonry.  Indeed the Church has, from Benedict XII to Benedict XV, unceasingly called attention to this arch-enemy and applied the strictest penalties against its adherents.  But the French Catholics perhaps saw less clearly than the Germans and did not want to believe the extremity of this danger ...

   <p>An outstanding representative of the French clergy, Father Jouin of St. Augustine in Paris, Domestic Prelate of His Holiness, has undertaken in several journals a well-directed and yet restrained campaign against the threatening power of Freemasonry.  In an essay appearing November 15, 1920 in the <em>Revue du Clergé Francais</em>, supported with powerful evidence and entitled “The Clergy and Jewish Freemasonry,” the excellent Prelate strenuously exhorts all French priests to study the Freemason question from its foundations, to fearlessly expose this frightful enemy that is sworn to the destruction of the Church, and to put it in the pillory.

   <p>In August 1920, the Abbess of the Benedictine nuns of Maredsous in Belgium told an archbishop who retold it several days later: “Sitting on the same seat where you are now, Herr Archbishop, Kaiser Wilhelm told me: ‘It was not I, but the Jews and Freemasons who wanted the war.’”... “’If from this day forward,’ writes Prelate Jouin, ‘the French clergy exerts itself with the Pope against Jewish Freemasonry, then France will turn itself against the world revolution and the life force will disappear from Jewish Freemasonry.’”

Thus the guardian of the Franciscan monastery in Bartha, Father Hugolinus Flyss suffered a true martyrdom.

<blockquote>“The Church and the Well-Being of the People”
   
<p>Despite all the progress of technology, art and science, the misery of ever wider elements of our people grows more and more instead of diminishing.  What is causing this remarkable phenomenon?  Mankind submits to the forces of nature under royal power; every day brings new discoveries, even the realm of the air acquiesce in our desire to conquer; at the same time, however, a great part of humanity is reduced to a continual struggle for survival.

   <p>It would be completely false to think that these facts flow only from an unequal distribution of the goods of this world and of intellectual gifts, or only from the overwhelming liberty in commerce and conduct which makes it possible for the stronger to exploit the weaker; no, the ultimate reason lies deeper: in people turning away from practical Christianity.  There is no blessing upon human industriousness, because people think they can do it without God, and yes, think they can establish a paradise on earth contrary to God’s will.  If the deepest reason for today’s great international evils is thus laid bare, then the main path is also shown for relieving this misery.

   <p>So long as the Church maintained its influence in the public life of the people, we knew little of the monstrous, miserable circumstances of which we complain in our countries.  Even our adversaries must admit that much.  The Social Democrat Kautsky writes in an article entitled “Work 500 Years Ago”: “That which is an ideal for today’s workers, for which they must wage a bitter struggle against the bourgeoisie, was an acknowledged reality half a millenium ago, in the ’Dark Middle Ages.’  Workers 500 years ago worked less strenuously and for shorter hours than today.  Despite that, their pay was higher.  Testifying to that fact are the many luxury prohibitions and levies of the 14th and 15th centuries, which declare that the worker is entitled to not more than two meat meals and a certain amount of wine or beer per day ... and in society is forbidden to dress in velvet and silk and the like.  Today such prohibitions would be highly superfluous.”

   <p>It was the Church that always performed the greatest deeds for the well-being of the people through the centuries by its emergence into the pagan world.  The Church took the poor to itself and spent alms on them; the Church loosed the chains of slaves and gave them freedom as citizens; the Church bound up the wounds of the injured and founded hospitals and clinics.  In view of such facts, even a Protestant author called the Catholic Church “a great asylum for humanity.” (Gregorovius, “History of the City of Rome …” II. 59)  And today – a struggle against this greatest of all benefactors of humanity!  And the struggle is by exactly those who always received the most help from her.  Yes, the leading standard-bearer of unbelief is the great seducer of the people, Social Democracy.  How is its snow-balling growth to be explained?  Of real success in the field of social legislation it has mighty little to show; these accomplishments have been done entirely by others.  But it is supremely well organized, and the main secret of its power is this:  it preaches also the gospel of free love and independence from all authority, even divine authority.  For that reason millions pledge allegiance to it, for whom the commandments of God have become burdensome fetters.  The happiness they so desire has not been attained thereby; on the contrary, they have become even more unhappy and appear to harbor more sinister resentments.  How far does it still have to go before people strike onto the path of recovery:  return to practical Christianity?  Then it will be confirmed once again, as a great thinker about religion said centuries ago:  “The Christian religion, which appears to have no other mission but happiness in the next world, has also established happiness in this world.”

<p>“Catchwords, Price Reduction and Bolshevism”

   <p>Today’s German people live in an era of catchwords.  The masses feed day by day on the catchwords that are thrown to them.  Sometimes it’s the phrase of price reduction, sometimes it’s Bolshevism.  It is remarkable!  How easily the people fall for such bait, without even thinking about it for a moment and testing it, they gladly go for it.  This is not a good advertisement for the country of thinkers, who have now become so sadly credulous.  May we finally learn once again how to think!  What are we saying now of the state of price reductions?  It says:  So long as raw materials are not in supply, goods are not in surplus, which is more than what is needed, and food is not as much as we need, so long as at least 23 billion marks annually must be extorted from the German people, for that long there will be no price reductions which are of any consequence.  But how would a reduction in prices be possible?  Only when and if the majority of the German population puts aside covetousness, all egoism, all spirit of exploitation and usury.  Only when and if all producers, all service providers, all workers were again satisfied with minimal goods.  If the manufacturer, the retailer and the merchant would want only what was really necessary to maintain a certain position in life and existence.  That so many chain transaction merchants, exploiters and usurers do not all at once become angels, we can all see, and thus the phrase about price reduction will long remain what it is today:  a catchword.

   <p>A further catchword, however, a much more dangerous one, is the hankering after the blessing of Russian Bolshevism, a blessing that must fill every thoughtful person with alarm.  It is certain that an invasion by, and cooperation with Russian Bolshevism would mean war for us, and in reality a war with a forebodingly  threatening subjugation such as no people has ever before been so terribly subjected to.  It is therefore infinitely easy to overlook ...  Social world brotherhood has failed as completely as one could ever imagine.  Isn’t it precisely the socialist government of France that is bringing us the greatest humiliations?  Let us leave the distant future to the foreknowledge of the Lord God!  Each and every injustice is avenged already on earth and no one will remember it, for: “Vengeance is mine! says the Lord God!”</p>

<p>“Christianity and Socialism”

   <p>Bebel wrote in a brochure “Christianity and Socialism”: “Christianity and Socialism are as different as fire and water,” and in the Reichstag he said: “In regard to religion, we take the standpoint of atheism.”

   <p>Liebknecht declared at the Party Congress at Halle in 1890: “Proper education must above all put aside religion.  Our Party is a party of science; science is hostile to religion.”

   <p>Lesinski wrote in the Socialist Monthly in 1912:  “To be a socialist means to be anti-Christian; the final victory will only be possible through the final overcoming of Christianity.”  Scientifically based Social Democracy takes the standpoint of Monism, which is so much like atheism.  It is well known that Kurt Eisner was an atheist of the purest sort, and former Culture Minister and Minister President Johannes Hoffmann revealed with special emphasis that in the field of school policy he is of a fanatically anti-religious disposition, in particular when he spoke on the state of culture in 1912.

   <p>The leader of a great assembly which the U.S.P. [Independent Socialist Party] held in the cattle market of Berlin on July 27, 1920, made the following remarkable statement, according to the report in “Germania”: “It is truly regrettable that nothing is accomplished in families toward real Social Democratic education.  Many colleagues intend to have done their duty if they are Party members and cast their votes for the reds.  They allow their children, after as before, to go into the religious dumming-down institutes of the clericalists and even go into the churches.  That must finally be radically broken off.”
   
<p>Christianity commands:  “Love your neighbor as yourself!  Do good to those who hate you. - What you do not want others to do to you, don’t do that to anyone else.”
   
<p>Karl Marx, on the other hand, recommends violence against violence, and the revolutionary Radek says:  “The Revolution does not discuss with its enemies, it smashes them.”  ...

<p>“... in this sense we praise once again: Overthrow of the bourgeois government, down with capitalism, crushing of the capitalist economic order, takeover of production by the proletariat, establishment of the soviet councils system; therefore comrades, all who are with us, knees on their chests, thumbs in their eyes, hang them from the lampposts, eye for eye, tooth for tooth.”
