   With reference to my telegram to you No. 3253 of October 16, 1 p.m., I am sending along today copy of the document referred to.  This document came into the hands of Sir Basil Thomson from French sources, and I am informed tht it was compiled by a Russian officer, whose identity is not known here.  For your own information I would state that Thomson obtained this during a protracted conversation with Prince Yousupoff who, perhaps you will remember, acquired a certain amount of notoriety some time ago by murdering Rasputin.
   You will note that it is stated on the first page that this information was in some way "établie par les services officiels américains (transmise par le Haut Commissaire de la République Française aux Etats-Unis)."  The source of this document is therefore obscure, and it is well within the range of possibility that the statements made in it have no basis of proof.  However, Thomson has received intelligence from several sources that the Bolsheviks are receiving money from wealthy American Jews, and he is anxious for our assistance to confirm or disprove these rumors.  Consequently, I would be glad if you could send me any facts bearing upon the alleged connection between Jacob Schiff et al with the Bolsheviks, and in particular with Martens.  
   The editors of the MORNING POST, at Thomson's request, have consented to withhold this information from publication at least for the present.  He has promised to do nothing further until he hears from us.
