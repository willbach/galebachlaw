<h3>Chapter 3. Vatican Policy Toward Nazi Germany in 1935 as the Swastika-Blessing Bishop Was Elevated to Cardinal</h3>

   <p>The early months of 1935 quickly demonstrated that any hope of friendly treatment of the Church by Hitler and the Nazi regime was in vain:

<blockquote>On January 28, 1935, the German Foreign Office informed Nunzio Orsenigo that Hitler would make no further concessions toward the implementation of the Concordat. 
<p>In February the Nazi regime intensified its campaign against Catholic denominational schools.
<p>In March Hitler announced he would institute universal military service, a violation of the Versailles Treaty – prompting Cardinal Pacelli to send a diplomatic note about Germany’s violation of the <a href="inotesi3.html#three02">secret codicil</a> to the Vatican-Germany Concordat, with its provisions applicable to Catholic priests and seminarians in the event of a military draft.
<p>In April the regime announced its intent to put an end to the Catholic youth movement.
<p>In May the regime began a series of highly publicized “currency trials” against bishops, priests, monks and nuns for international currency transfers allegedly in violation of German law.</blockquote>

   <p>Cardinal Pacelli resumed sending frequent diplomatic <a href="inotesi3.html#three03">protest notes</a> from late January onward, but the record shows little response and no concessions by the German Government.  A May 10, 1935 <a href="inotesi3.html#three04">document</a> from the German Foreign Office Archive shows that, even in a climate of conflict between Church and State in Germany, German Ambassador Diego von Bergen in Rome followed <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> and cited it to his masters in Berlin as evidence of Vatican policy toward Nazism, Fascism and Germany.</p><br>
<h4>The Swastika Blessing Photograph Appears</h4>

   <p>It is not known how the photograph of Archbishop Copello’s swastika blessing ceremony traveled from Argentina to Germany, or why it took almost 10 months from the ceremony to its publication in the <em>Stürmer</em>, or who had possession of it during the interval.  It is likely that the photograph reached <em>Stürmer</em> editor Julius Streicher shortly before he published it in the <a href="inotesi3.html#three06">third week</a> of July, 1935.  Streicher tailored issue number 29 around the photograph in several identifiable ways that indicate his eagerness to make use of it. 

   <p>On July 7, 1935, German Interior Minister Frick gave a speech in Münster, Germany, strongly criticizing “political Catholicism,” the involvement of clergy in commenting on political issues from the pulpit.  

   <p>On July 16, 1935, Hanns Kerrl was appointed cabinet minister for Church Affairs in the German Reich Government.  As we will see in the subsequent weeks, he took an initially favorable position on two issues of high concern to Vatican policy, the restraining of neo-pagan propagandizing by Rosenberg and similar Nazi ideologists, and the resuming of Concordat implementing negotiations.

   <p>On a date between July 15 and July 21, the swastika blessing photograph appeared on page 5 of the <em>Stürmer</em>.  Above the photograph, and continuing below it, Streicher placed an article entitled “Hatred Extending Beyond the Grave.”  The text recalled the Diocese of Mainz denying a Catholic burial to Nazi Gauleiter Peter Gemeinder [misspelled by Streicher as Gmeinder] in 1931.  That, along with a pastor’s refusal to bury a Hitler youth with a swastika flag or mourners wearing swastika armbands, was “hatred.”  Archbishop Copello, the reader was left to infer, was a contrasting example of Christian love and pastoral care.  Gemeinder was held up as an example of a Catholic who loved priests and hated “<em>pfaffen</em>.”  This contemptuous slang term for priests was explained in a <a href="inotesi3.html#three07">companion piece</a> on page 3, entitled “<em>Priester und Pfaffen</em>.”

   <p>To the right of the photograph Streicher placed a <a href="inotesi3.html#three08">short piece</a> under the headline, “Who Governs Russia,” asserting that 447 of the approximately 550 upper level officials of Soviet Russia were Jews.  The propagandistic equating of Jews and Communists, as well as linking them to Freemasons, was reinforced in an article further down on page 5, where Hitler Youth head Baldur von Schirach was quoted denouncing “Jews, Freemasons and Jews’ lackeys.”  The third term of this phrase was Nazi slang for Communists and Socialists.  Here is page 5 of number 29 of the <em>Stürmer</em> in 1935, from the microfilm on which Stephen Galebach first discovered it, with English translations added:</p>

<div class="picture center" style="width:1002px;"> <img src="Diane1/19350715GermanySturmerp5.jpg" width="1000" height="1355" alt="Der Sturmer"/><br /><em>Der Stürmer</em> with English translations of headlines and slogans</em></div></center>

 
   <p>A photograph on page one of this issue of the <em>Stürmer</em> was more subtle, but understandable to any passerby perusing this issue of the <em>Stürmer</em> in a display case in the local town or city plaza.  It was a photo of the <em>Stürmer</em> display case in the City of Mainz, showing <em>Stürmer</em> readers at the place were a Catholic Diocese had mounted the strongest public ecclesiastical resistance to Nazism, a resistance which was now eclipsed by an official ceremony at an International Eucharistic Congress.

   <p>One week later, the next issue of the <em>Stürmer</em> carried yet another feature entitled “Hatred Extending Beyond the Grave.”  This time it was a current instance of a Catholic priest refusing to celebrate the annual mass for a veterans’ association, because there were some “swastika men” [<em>Hakenkreuzler</em>] among the veterans.  Still riding the moral high ground from the week before, the <em>Stürmer</em> concluded the article:  “And this is called a representative of Christ’s love of neighbor!  Hatred extending beyond the grave!” 

   <p>On July 31, 1935, Vatican Nuncio Orsenigo visited the German Foreign Office to make a protest about material appearing on a <em>Stürmer</em> display case near the Tiergarten in Berlin, a few blocks from the Vatican Nunciature on Rauchstrasse.  His complaint did not concern any of the Catholic-related content in the previous two weekly issues of the <em>Stürmer</em>.  Rather it concerned a picture of the Pope, with “malicious graffiti,” on the display case.  The Nuncio’s visit and complaint were documented in a <a href="inotesi3.html#three10">memorandum</a> written by an official in the German Foreign Office. </p><br>

<h4>August 1935:  <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> Promotes an Antisemitic Novel for Argentina</h4>

   <p>On August 3, 1935 <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published an article entitled “L’Oro, la moneta ed i Giudei” [Gold, Money and the Jews].  The article favorably reviewed a two-part novel, entitled <em>El Kahal</em> and <em>Oro</em>, recently published in Argentina by <a href="inotesi3.html#three11">Gustavo Martinez Zuvíria</a> under the pseudonym Hugo Wast.  Martinez Zuvíria had been head of the Press and Publicity Committee for the International Eucharistic Congress the year before.

   <p><em>El Kahal-Oro</em> was an intensely antisemitic novel.  It reworked the basic themes of the <a href="inotesi3.html#three12"><em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em></a> into a contemporary Jewish conspiracy threatening to take over not only the world, but Argentina in particular.  The novel’s reliance on the <em>Protocols</em> was explicit, beginning with the cover and title page, and extending throughout the story.  The serpent on the cover depicted the course of the Jewish world conspiracy from the time of Solomon's kingdom to the "Jewish-Bolshevik" revolution in Russia.  


<center>
<div class="picture center" style="width:902px;"> <img src="Diane1/19350803Kahalcover.jpg" width="900" height="565" alt="El Kahal cover" /> <br /><em>El Kahal</em> cover: Jewish world conspiracy from Solomon's kingdom to the Russian Revolution</div></center>

<p><em>El Kahal’s</em> title page explained the serpent imagery with a quotation from the <em>Protocols</em>: “A little longer and the Serpent, symbol of our people, will tighten its coils and strangle all the nations. <em>Protocols of Zion</em>, Session 3:30.” 

<p>The introduction of <em>El Kahal</em> <a href="inotesi3.html#three13">explained that the Russian Revolution was</a> a "current and complete example" of the international Jewish conspiracy to destroy Christian civilization.  The author concluded the introduction with these two lines:
   <blockquote>“And this is the reason that among all peoples, the cry ‘death to the Jew!’ has almost always been synonymous with ‘long live the Fatherland!’”
  <p>  “Because two nationalities cannot coexist in the same nation.”</blockquote>

<p> The term <em>El Kahal</em> denoted the secret Jewish ruling council.  Antisemites of the time, including American industrialist <a href="inotesi3.html#three13a">Henry Ford, accused</a> a "Kahal" in New York of directing nefarious Jewish intrigues worldwide, under the leadership of Rabbi Judah Magnes. The cover of <em>El Kahal's</em> sequel, entitled <em>Oro</em> [Gold] and published also in 1935, invoked this propaganda meme by showing the Jewish world conspiracy serpent striking from New York City to Buenos Aires. 

<div class="picture left" style="width:502px;"> <img src="Diane1/19350803Orocover.jpg" width="500" height="684" alt="Oro cover"/><br/>The Jewish world conspiracy now menaces Argentina</div>


   <p><em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> praised the author of <em>El Kahal</em> and <em>Oro</em> as a modern-day St. Thomas More, and his novel as a work comparable to More’s famous <em>Utopia</em>.  The <a href="inotesi3.html#three14">article</a> summarized the antisemitic plot of the novel, with Jews cornering the market on gold and commerce in order to control politics and wars, “all in order to completely enslave Christians, destroy Christianity and establish Jewish world domination.”  But <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> rendered the <em>ipse dixit</em> that “this is not an antisemitic novel.”  <a href="inotesi3.html#three15">Historians</a> of the <em>Protocols</em> and of the development of antisemitism in Argentina have described the impact of <em>El Kahal-Oro</em> in that country, where it went through dozens of editions and sold over 200,000 copies, but they have not mentioned the promotion of the novel by <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em>.

  <p> The authority of <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> as a Vatican-supervised publication outweighed <em>Criterio</em>, the leading Catholic intellectual journal of Argentina, which had criticized the menacing antisemitism of <em>El Kahal</em> in a pre-publication review several months before, and had earlier debunked the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em> as a fraud.  A regular contributor to Criterio challenged the antisemitism of <em>El Kahal</em> as it gained momentum, but the result was his disappearance as a contributor.  <a href="inotesi3.html#three16">Manuel Gálvez</a>’s words, prescient for their time in 1936, are still noteworthy today: 

<blockquote>"I will always insist that antisemitism is an error and a danger for everyone.  To provoke antisemitic sentiments is equivalent – we know it, and the Jews know from many centuries of experience! – to inciting the people to kill Jews.  A true Catholic, a man who loves Christ, cannot, in any way, approve persecution against the Jews."</blockquote><br><br>

<h4>Criticism of Nazi Officials from Rome</h4>

   <p>On August 4, 1935, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> published a lengthy front-page commentary, “The Religious Situation in Germany.”  The <a href="inotesi3.html#three17">article</a> denounced statements by Interior Minister Frick as inconsistent with the Vatican-Germany Concordat and responded to accusations by Göring against “political Catholicism.”  The Vatican newspaper also critiqued at length the anti-Catholic ideas propagated by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg.  A <em>Kulturkampf</em> in Germany, thanks to Rosenberg and his comrades, was not “a danger for the future,” but “a tragic present reality.”  The front page of this issue also featured a rebuttal to an article in the Nazis’ <em>Völkischer Beobachter</em>, which had claimed the Vatican was negotiating a concordat with the Soviet Union.

   <p>On August 17 in Rome, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published an <a href="inotesi3.html#three20">article</a> similar to what appeared in the Vatican newspaper on August 4, entitled “Religious Persecution in Germany.”  The article described the “strange oppression by the German Government that is multiplying and getting worse every day toward Catholics, merely because of fidelity to their religion and resistance to the apostasy that certain factors of Nazism would like to impose on them, to the extreme of paganism ...”  Neither <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> nor <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> criticized Hitler in these articles.  <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> did not criticize him by name in any of the articles we examined in this investigation.

   <p>On August 17 in Germany, the Nazi regime issued a decree ordering the dissolution of all <a href="inotesi3.html#three21">Freemason lodges</a> in the country. </p><br>
<h4>September to Christmas, 1935:  The Nuremberg Laws</h4>

  <p>In early September, Streicher published a <a href="inotesi3.html#three22">special edition</a> of the <em>Stürmer</em> for the upcoming annual Nazi Party Congress.  The edition was devoted to showing that Judaism was equivalent to Soviet Communism, that Jews controlled Soviet Russia, and that Jewish-Communism was a mortal threat to Germany.  Streicher included a photograph of Stalin with a caption identifying him as a non-Jew who is “not the ruler of Russia.”  A photograph of Stalin’s henchman Lazar Kaganovich appeared with a caption identifying him as a Jew and as “the real dictator of Russia.”

   <p>On September 7, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published a further <a href="inotesi3.html#three23">report</a> on the religious situation in Germany.  The opening sentence stated that “escalation of Nazi totalitarianism against Catholic sentiment” was continuing.  The second part recounted incidents in Germany showing that “the struggle against the Jews is marked by a fresh outbreak of violent incidents.”

   <p>On September 13, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> provided front-page <a href="inotesi3.html#three24">coverage</a> of the 1935 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg.  Describing the opening session, the Vatican newspaper twice mentioned Streicher in the company of Hitler and his top lieutenants.  Hitler’s lieutenant Rudolf Hess, the article recounted, called Germany “the strongest bulwark against the international expansion of Bolshevism.”  The article then quoted extensively from Hitler’s proclamation to the Congress, which denounced “Jewish Marxism” and the “Catholic Center Party” as <a href="inotesi3.html#three26">traditional enemies</a> of Nazism.  The Nazi State, Hitler declared, was continuing on course to overcome the “grave danger” of the Jews.  In a concluding paragraph of commentary, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> objected to Hitler’s remarks about Catholicism and political priests.  It did not comment about his remarks on the Jews.

   <p>On September 15, the Vatican newspaper placed the issue of “Jewish Communism” squarely on page one.  On the same day Germany enacted the infamous Nuremberg Laws, (1) proclaiming the swastika the national flag, (2) stripping Jewish Germans of their citizenship, and (3) prohibiting marriage and sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews and barring Jews from hiring female non-Jewish domestics under age 45, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> reported the speech by Nazi propaganda chief Goebbels which laid the foundational rationale of those laws.  Under the title “Goebbels against Communism,” the newspaper published a summary which included Goebbels’ claims that Judaism was the “original cause” of Bolshevism and that Jews were centrally involved in all modern revolutions.  A concluding paragraph added an endorsement into the report.  Germany and its leader, the article said, were carrying out a “mission” for which all nations should be grateful, by warning about the worldwide danger of Jewish-inspired Communism.

   <p>The article about Goebbels’ speech, which followed a page one report about three Hitler <a href="inotesi3.html#three27">speeches</a>, reads as follows:</p>
                                             <center>“Goebbels Against Communism”</center>

   <blockquote>Minister Goebbels also spoke at the Congress yesterday, refuting an article that appeared in a London newspaper under the title “Two Dictators,” in which a parallel was drawn between the Nazi and Soviet regimes.  The minister emphasized the fundamental difference between Communism and Nazism, irreconcilable doctrines, the one destructive of culture and the other constructive and uplifting for higher national and social values.  Then Goebbels gave a detailed presentation of the Communists' methods and their results in the economic and social life of Russia, as well as the bloody battle that Nazism was obliged to sustain in order to prevent Communism from becoming established in Germany and transforming it into a danger and threat to Europe and the whole world. The minister denounced Judaism as the original cause of Bolshevism, demonstrating with citations and names that in all the countries where there are revolutionary disorders, the Communist tendency of the Jewish elements has played an important part in their preparation and their execution.

   <p>Sustaining its battle against Communism without ceasing and without compromise, Germany and its head are carrying out a mission for which all the nations should be grateful.  The period of Communist revolution continues menacingly for all peoples.  Without presuming to intrude in the internal politics of any country or to give counsel to any government, Germany is raising its voice of warning to all the nations against the gravity of the danger that Communism, of Jewish inspiration, represents for their culture and their existence.</blockquote>

    <p>The Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory, as propounded by Goebbels, was the Nazis’ <a href="inotesi3.html#three28">rationale</a> for decreeing draconian laws against the Jews of Germany at the Nazi Party Congress of 1935.  This rationale was prominent in the lead-up to the Congress, as we saw in the special edition of the <em>Stürmer</em>.  At the Congress, Hitler equated Jews with Communists and explained the Nuremberg Laws as a “solution” to “international Israelite agitation” which threatened Germany and the whole world.

   <p>In giving such prominent and favorable coverage to Goebbels’ speech, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> not only gave credence to the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory, it reinforced Bishop Hudal’s message about Nazi Germany’s providential mission.  The central aspect of that mission was described identically in the Vatican’s newspaper on September 15, 1935 and on September 28, 1934:  a bulwark, battling against the danger of Communism.  But the 1935 article added a further aspect surrounding that mission:  the association of Communism and Judaism.

   <p>Top Vatican officials were not unaware that the Jewish-Communist identity was being used by the Nazi regime in September 1935 for an evil long-term purpose.  On September 14, 1935, Vatican Nuncio Orsenigo sent a <a href="inotesi3.html#three29">communiqué</a> to Cardinal Pacelli reporting that the Nazi regime was preparing laws that would mean the eventual end of Jews in Germany, based on the theory that Judaism controls Soviet Communism.  

   <p>Goebbels’ <a href="inotesi3.html#three30">diary</a> discloses the value he placed on gaining international publicity for this particular speech.   Publication in an internationally respected newspaper was useful for gaining acceptance of an <a href="inotesi3.html#three31">inherently</a> non-credible theory.  The Nazis’ emphasis on the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory can also be seen in <a href="inotesi3.html#three32">Hitler’s speech</a> on September 15th justifying the Nuremberg Laws as a defensive measure against Jewish-Communist world revolution.  <a href="inotesi3.html#three33">Göring</a>, speaking as President of the Reichstag, which was summoned specially for this occasion, proclaimed the swastika to be the “anti-Jewish symbol of the world.”  His words echoed <a href="inotesi3.html#three35">Hitler’s</a> explanation a decade earlier that the swastika symbolized the antisemitic mission of the Nazi Party.  These factors help explain <a href="inotesi3.html#three36">Hitler’s</a> meaning when he declared to the Congress that the three Nuremberg Laws were “intimately related” to the Nazi movement.  The law depriving Jewish Germans of citizenship fulfilled point 4 of the Nazi Party Program of February 24, 1920, which proclaimed that only members of the <em>Volk</em> can be German citizens and that no Jew can be a member of the <em>Volk</em>.

   <p>The Vatican’s September 15 front page coverage of Goebbels’ speech gave it international publicity from the most credible news source in the Catholic world. Vatican endorsement of the foundational rationale of the Nuremberg Laws, on the day of their enactment, <a href="inotesi3.html#three37">signaled</a> support for those laws to Catholics worldwide, despite their <a href="inotesi3.html#three38">violation</a> of Catholic Church doctrine and canon law concerning marriage.  <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em>’s extensive coverage of the Nuremberg Laws in the days and weeks after September 15, with no word of criticism, reinforced the signal.   In this light, it is easier to understand what many <a href="inotesi3.html#three40">historians have reported</a>:  that no German Bishop criticized the Nuremberg Laws.  It must also be noted that, while the Nuremberg Laws violated canon law by infringing upon the Church's authority to decide whom a Catholic could marry, in other respects they mirrored regulations that were in effect in the Papal States until their fall in 1870.

  <p> The September 16-17, 1935 issue of <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> published a <a href="inotesi3.html#three42">detailed summary</a> of the Nuremberg Laws, without criticism.  The same issue published a <a href="inotesi3.html#three43">detailed critique</a> of another aspect of the Nazi Party Congress, Hitler’s verbal attack on “political Catholicism.”  In the days that followed, the Vatican’s newspaper repeatedly addressed various aspects of the Nuremberg Laws and their implementation.

   <p>On September 18, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> reported <a href="inotesi3.html#three44">Hitler’s speech</a> to troops at the military parade in Nuremberg the day before, including his statements that Germany “owes its salvation” to the Nazi Party alone, and that absolute obedience to the authority of the Nazi Party is “an imperative necessity.” At least <a href="inotesi3.html#three45">one historian</a> has observed that "the Vatican paper rarely published speeches of politicians." Publishing a political leader's speech to a military parade was all the more unusual. The rarity of such treatment made <em>L'Osservatore Romano's</em> focus on Hitler's and Goebbels' speeches surrounding the Nuremberg Laws all the more significant. 

   <p>From September 18th to 26th, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> ran <a href="inotesi3.html#three46">five short pieces</a> on the implementation and impact of the Nuremberg Laws, including the new status of Jews in Germany as foreigners without a country, and the roll-out of the swastika flag as the national flag.  <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> ran its <a href="inotesi3.html#three47">coverage</a> of the Nazi Party Congress on October 5, abstaining from comment on the Nuremberg Laws while covering some of Hitler’s speeches, and summarizing a recent joint pastoral letter of the German Bishops.

   <p>Coverage of the Nuremberg Laws <a href="inotesi3.html#three48">resumed</a> in <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> on November 17, when the Nazi regime issued regulations defining who was a Jew.  On <a href="inotesi3.html#three50">Christmas Day</a> 1935, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> reported that the leader of the Jewish Cultural Association of Germany had expressed his support for the Nuremberg Laws.

   <p>In the second half of 1935, Bishop Hudal published another <a href="inotesi3.html#three51">book</a>, in which he incorporated the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory for the first time in his series of books:

<blockquote>Wherever revolutions and government upheavals come to pass, Moscow has a hand in the act.  It is the religious and moral dregs of Judaism, coming forth from Moscow today, that keep the Christian peoples of Europe in constant unrest, in order to prepare the way for the worldwide dominion of a race that has given mankind precious cultural values and outstanding personages, but which, as soon as it is loosened from its religious roots, must undermine every other cultural field.</blockquote>

   <p>The years that followed would prove the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory to be the <a href="inotesi3.html#three52">primary rationale for the Holocaust</a>, just as it had served as the primary rationale for the Nuremberg Laws in 1935.

   <p>On November 21, 1935 the New York Times reported the selection of a new Cardinal from South America.  Santiago Luis Copello, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, became the first Cardinal from Argentina, and the first ever from Spanish-speaking South America, at a consistory in Rome on December 16, 1935.

   <p>In the months that followed, neither <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> nor <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> revoked or revised their 1935 promotions of Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory.  Bishop Hudal incorporated the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory into yet another new book, <em>The Foundations of National Socialism</em>, a pre-publication copy of which was <a href="inotesi3.html#three53">presented personally</a> by Franz von Papen to Hitler in June 1936 in a persistent effort to gain Hitler’s approval for the <a href="inotesi3.html#three55">book</a>.  Even when the Vatican disavowed sponsorship of Hudal’s book in a notice in <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> five months later, it signaled continuing willingness to promulgate the Jewish-Communist conspiracy theory on the very same <a href="inotesi3.html#three56">page</a>.  And in March 1937, when Pope Pius XI issued his <a href="inotesi3.html#three57">encyclical</a> <em>Mit Brennender Sorge</em>, strongly criticizing the Nazi regime’s countless violations of the Concordat and condemning several key points of Nazi ideology, he said nothing against the Nazis’ central campaign to dehumanize Jews, to equate them all with Communists, and to remove them from the German nation.</p><br>
