<p>Mr. Education Minister sent me on March 30th a letter (Enclosure I), in which he explained the demands (Enclosure II), from his point of view, that were put forward by the Bavarian Government, with a view to concluding the new Concordat. The long-standing close relationship existing between the State and the Catholic Church in Bavaria (explains Dr. Matt), and above all the relationships developed under the Concordat of 1817, have allowed ideas to develop in the mentality of Bavarian Catholics, which require indeed for the future on the part of said State as on the part of the Church, reciprocal regard and mutual assistance...</blockquote>

<p>Your Excellency,

<p>I have the honor now, in follow-up to my devoted letter of the 18th of this month, to convey the proposals that, by my assessment, are to be set down by the Bavarian State Government for the concluding of a new Concordat with the Holy See. As the basis of these proposals, I believe I do not have to add very extensive explanations. The long history of a close bond of the Bavarian State with the Catholic Church in Bavaria, and particularly the relations established by the Concordat of 1817, have created a rooted legacy in the mentality of Bavarian Catholics, of concepts that entail, indeed for the future, reciprocal considerations and requirements from State and Church. The new Constitution of the German Reich has certainly guaranteed the Church all the more freedom of conducting its affairs within the framework of public law.
