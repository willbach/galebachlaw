<h3><u>1800s</u></h3>

<p><strong>Circa 1800</strong> Napoleon’s armies set Jews free throughout Europe from ghettoes and legal discrimination, including in the Papal States.

<a name="1800"></a><blockquote><a href="#JewishMasonicThread"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicLeft.jpg"></a><a href="#18690000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicRight.jpg"></a> Earliest known allegations of Jewish-Masonic conspiracy behind the French Revolution are made by Abbé Augustin Barruel, a French Jesuit priest.</blockquote>

<p><strong>1815</strong> Following the defeat of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna re-establishes European monarchies; in the restored Papal States, Pope Pius VII re-institutes the ghettoes of Rome, Bologna and several other cities.

<p><strong>1819</strong> The Hep-Hep riots in Germany, a series of pogroms in Würzburg and then cities in the Rhineland and the north, kill or injure many Jews and loot their property.

<p><strong>June 16, 1846</strong> Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti is elected Pope and takes the name Pius IX; his 31-year Pontificate, the longest on record, witnesses the fall of the Papal States and the forming of the nation of Italy.

<p><strong>1848-1849</strong> A popular movement establishes a democratic republican form of government in Rome and Pope Pius IX flees to Gaeta Castle near Naples.

<p><strong>1850</strong> French troops overpower Roman Republic forces and institute military rule on behalf of the Pope; the following year Pius XI returns to Rome.

<p><strong>1858</strong> Edgardo Mortara, a six year old Jewish boy, is taken from his family in Bologna by Papal States police and taken to Rome. 

<blockquote>Pope Pius IX refuses to return Edgardo to his family; the resulting worldwide outrage undermines Austrian and French commitment to uphold Pius IX’s temporal rule.</blockquote> 

<p><strong>1859</strong> Austrian troops leave Bologna and the Romagna region of the Papal States, and democratic forces immediately rise up and form new governing bodies.

<p><a href="#1800"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicLeft.jpg"></a><a href="#18710000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicRight.jpg"></a><a name="18690000"></a> <strong>1869</strong> The <a href="ibibliography.html#8">Vatican-supervised</a> journal <em>La Civiltà Cattolica</em> equates Judaism and the Masonic movement, describing a “vast conspiracy” by the “Jewish-Masonic sect” to attack the Catholic Church, destroy its religious orders, and steal their property.  <a href="iet1800.html#aa1">English translation of article</a>

<blockquote>Historian Lebovitch Dahl has traced <em>Civiltà Cattolica’s</em> Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theorizing back to the journal’s first volume of 1850 and its four-part series entitled “The Hebrew of Verona.” (see <a href="ibibliography.html#Dahl">Bibliography</a>)

<p>Also, in 1869, Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theory appears as a central theme in a book by French writer Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux, who makes dozens of references to prominent Jewish French lawyer Adolphe Crémieux, the head of the Alliance Israélite Universelle and the French Masonic order, in order to insinuate that Jewry controls Masonry worldwide.

<p>Excerpts in <a href="iet1800.html#a1">French original</a> and <a href="iet1800.html#a2">English translation</a> from Gougenot’s <em>Le Juif: le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens</em> (Paris: Plons, 1869)

<p>In 1870, Gougenot’s book receives an <a href="iet1800.html#a3">enthusiastic review</a> from <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em>.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sept. 20, 1870</strong> Italian troops breach the walls of Rome, and Papal Zouaves surrender the city to the forces of Italian unification.

<blockquote>This marks the end of the Papal States as an entity under the sovereignty of the Pope.

<p>The “Roman Question,” the competing claims of the Pope and the nation of Italy to sovereignty over Rome, persists for many decades until resolved in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and Mussolini.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jan. 1, 1871</strong> Germany is united under Kaiser Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, and Jews receive rights of citizenship throughout the new German Reich, or Empire.

<p><a href="#18690000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicLeft.jpg"></a><a href="#18800000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicRight.jpg"></a> <a name="18710000"></a> <strong>1871</strong> Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theory is advanced in Germany by the Jesuit priest August Rohling in his book <em>Der Talmudjude</em> [the Talmud-Jew], which quickly sells multiple editions and is translated into French, Polish, Dutch, Hungarian and other languages.

<blockquote>English translation and German original of excerpt, including generalizing from the example of Adolphe Crémieux to a theory of universal control of Masonry by Jewry.</blockquote>

<p><strong>1878</strong> Kaiser Wilhelm I’s Lutheran chaplain Adolf Stoecker founds the <em>Christlichsoziale Arbeiterpartei</em> [Christian-Social Workers Party], one of several German antisemitic parties that have limited electoral success in the late 1800s and decline by the time of World War I.

<blockquote>The name and concept of <em>Christlichsoziale</em>, combining antisemitic propaganda with social programs for workers, are later adopted by <a href="#18960815">Karl Lueger’s</a> political movement in Austria.</blockquote> 

<p><strong>Feb. 20, 1878</strong> Vincenzo Pecci, Bishop of Perugia, Italy, is elected Pope Leo XIII and enters upon a 25-year pontificate.

<h3><u>1880s</u></h3>

<p><a href="#18710000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicLeft.jpg"></a><a href="#18840000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicRight.jpg"></a><a name="18800000"></a> <strong>1880</strong> E.N. Chabouty, a French Catholic priest, publishes a book devoted to Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theory: <em>Franc-maçons et Juifs: Sixième âge de l’église d'après l’apocalypse</em> [Freemasons and Jews: Sixth Age of the Church According to the Book of Revelation] (Paris: Société générale de librairie catholique, 1880).

<p><strong>Dec. 1880</strong> <em>La Civiltà Cattolica</em> [Catholic Civilization] commences a series of polemical articles against the Jewish people.

<blockquote>These antisemitic articles extend over a period of more than three years, appearing in approximately half the issues of this journal during that time.

<p><em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> was (and still is) a twice-monthly journal published by a select community of Jesuit priests in Rome, with each issue reviewed by the Vatican Secretary of State prior to publication.</blockquote>

<a name="18810101"></a><p><strong>Jan. 1, 1881</strong> <em>Civiltà Cattolica’s</em> first lengthy antisemitic article demands special laws to exclude Jews from citizenship and profitable occupations, and to counteract alleged Jewish financial and economic influence.  

<blockquote>The article’s main points are that Jews remain foreigners in whatever country they live; that they universally inspire people to hate them; that Judaism should be understood as a race more than a religion; and that antisemitism should be pursued in a “just” and rational manner, rather than a passionate and vengeful manner.

<p><a href="iet1800.html#1">English translation of the article</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The main points of the article were, or became, a commonplace in antisemitic propaganda; they appear, for instance, in Hitler’s first known antisemitic writing, <a href="19190916">his letter to Gemlich in September 1919.</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>1881</strong>  Pogroms, violent attacks and riots against Jews, break out in Russia, the home of approximately half the world’s Jewish population, following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. 

<p><strong>1882</strong> The First Aliya begins.

<blockquote>Thousands of Jews emigrate from Russia and Romania to Palestine, with the foundation of settlements such as Rishon LeZion (“First in Zion”) southeast of Jaffa and Rosh Pina (“Cornerstone”) northwest of the Sea of Galilee.  

<p>Also, more than one million Jews emigrate from Russia to the United States by the end of the 19th century.  Tens of thousands emigrate during this time to Argentina, which sends immigration agents to Warsaw and Odessa to recruit Jewish immigrants to the largely unpopulated country.  Baron Maurice de Hirsch (from a Jewish Bavarian family living in France, having been ennobled by the King of Bavaria) finances Jewish immigration to Argentina.</blockquote>

<p><a href="#18800000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicLeft.jpg"></a><a href="#18940000"><img src="Diane7/IconJewishMasonicRight.jpg"></a><a name="18840000"></a> <strong>Apr. 20, 1884</strong>  Pope Leo XIII issues an encyclical entitled <em>Humanum Genus</em>, dedicated to condemning the Freemasons and exhorting Catholics to oppose them as forces of the “kingdom of Satan” arrayed against “the kingdom of God on earth,” the Catholic Church.  

<blockquote>This encyclical does not posit any connection between Freemasons and Jews; nor did any of Leo XIII’s encyclicals or other public statements contain any explicit denigration of Jews.

<h3><u>1890s</u></h3>

<p><strong>May 15, 1891</strong>  Pope Leo XIII issues his most famous encyclical, <em>Rerum Novarum</em>, on capital and labor, which continues to be central to Catholic social teaching through the 20th century.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html">English version at Vatican website</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="iet1800.html#2">English translation of French original</a>

<p><em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> <a href="#18960919">later praises the works of Dr. Bataille and other anti-Masonic works by Jogand-Pagès under his various pseudonyms.</a>

<p>When Jogand-Pagès discloses in 1897 that his writings have been a gigantic hoax, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> condemns him but <a href="#18970515">states that much of what he wrote is nonetheless true.</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Dec. 22, 1894</strong> Jewish French General Staff officer Alfred Dreyfus is falsely convicted by court-martial of espionage and treason, in the midst of an antisemitic propaganda campaign against him.

<a name="18960000"></a><p><strong>1896</strong> Theodor Herzl publishes the book that launches the Zionist movement, <em>Der Judenstaat</em> [The Jewish State].

<blockquote>Herzl, having seen the impact of the Dreyfus Affair as a journalist posted to France, argues that despite best efforts and intentions, Jews are unable to gain acceptance and toleration in any country. 

<p>Herzl’s book proposes a solution: that Jews establish or re-establish their own homeland. He also proposes that the Holy Places of Christianity and Islam, including the city of Jerusalem, be internationalized and not be part of the Jewish State.

<p>Also in 1896, antisemitic agitation surges in France in reaction against the pro-Dreyfusard movement, and in Austria with the electoral victory of Karl Lueger’s Christian Social Party, also known as the Antisemitic Party.</blockquote>

<a name="18990916"></a><p><strong>Sept. 16, 1899</strong> <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> writes this about the Third Zionist Congress, noting the Zionists are not claiming Jerusalem: 

<blockquote>“What sort of Zionism is this, that from the start renounces Jerusalem and the ancient kingdom of Palestine?  Does this not prove that they are betraying themselves and confessing that their intentions were utopian?  Why not then completely give up the name Zionism?  A race of murderers of God, even if supported by all the anti-Christian sects, feels itself beaten before the fight even begins, beaten by Jesus.”

<blockquote>However, inasmuch as the situation in Palestine is not yet definitely regulated, We now raise Our voice that, when the time comes to establish there a permanent condition of things, to the Catholic Church and to all Christians shall be assured the inalienable rights they hold.  Certainly We have no desire that any damage shall be done to the rights of the Jewish element; what We mean is that they must in no way be put above the just rights of the Christians.

<blockquote>“Concerning the ‘consecration of flags’ the customary practices of the individual dioceses remain unchanged.”  

<p>Source: “Minutes of the Plenary Conference of the German Bishops,” Aug. 29-31, 1933, reprinted in Stasiewski, <em>German Bishops Papers, supra</em> 3-29-33, vol. 1, p. 337.</blockquote>

<a name="19330830"></a><p><strong>Aug. 30, 1933</strong>  Bavarian Bishops Conference considers whether to relax prohibitions on blessings of swastika flags and adopts a formulation that neither authorizes nor strictly prohibits flag blessing ceremonies:  

<blockquote>“On the question whether the swastika flag, now explained to be a Reich flag, shall be consecrated:  the Conference has until now rejected the consecration of political flags and today is still of this view, that with the admittance into the worship services in the nave of the Church a certain consecration is conferred, without the rite of consecration.  The Conference does not want to insist on a strict veto, since the decree of the [Vatican] Congregation of Rites of December 15, 1922 and March 26, 1924 leaves open the possibility of such a consecration of flags, cf. AAS [Acta Apostolicae Sedis] 1924 No. 4, Apr. 1, p.171.”

<p>Note:  In light of the resistance of Cardinal Faulhaber and other Bishops to displaying the swastika flag on churches on designated “patriotic days” or holidays in 1934, the effect of the Bavarian Bishops’ resolution of Aug. 30, 1933 appears to be that Bishops did not bless or consecrate swastika flags, but also did not threaten priests with strict discipline if they did so.</blockquote>
