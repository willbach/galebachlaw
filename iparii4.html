<h3>Chapter 8. Further Interaction Between Catholic Authority and Nazism, 1921-1933</h3>

   <p>On March 7, 1921, the Archbishop of Munich, Michael von Faulhaber, was elevated to Cardinal.  We found no indication during 1921 or 1922 that the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> retracted its militant antisemitic propaganda of 1920, or that Cardinal Faulhaber counteracted it in any identifiable way.  The Nazi Party continued its slow but steady <a href="inotesii4.html#ii402">growth</a> in numbers, reaching 3,300 by August 1921, compared to 2,000 at the end of 1920, and 190 at the start of 1920.  Although the Nazis were still a small group in 1921 compared to other political parties in Bavaria, they made themselves conspicuous with their placards and swastikas in Munich.
 
  <p>A public <a href="inotesii4.html#ii403">letter</a> of complaint from a Jewish citizen of Bavaria to the Munich Police Chief offers a contemporary perspective on the high visibility of the antisemitic movement as of the first half of 1921 in Munich.  The letter also reflects on Police Chief Pöhner’s increasing toleration of antisemitic incitements, and on the silence of the leaders of the main Bavarian Catholic political party in parliamentary debates over the growing menace of antisemitism:
 
<blockquote>German-<em>Völkisch</em> excesses are, at the moment, the order of the day in Bavaria and especially in Munich ... In recent days, moreover, placards flaunting swastikas were displayed at all the street corners of Munich … Insofar as these placards made a demand for the exclusion of Jews from eligibility to vote, from the universities and from the press, such frills and phantasies may find their pathological motivation in the heat wave that set in unusually early in Bavaria this summer ... We are not unaware that the Bavarian Ministers of Commerce and Finance, in particular, are well informed of the seriousness and extent of this state of affairs, that the Ministerial Cabinet in recent days took up these matters once again, and that the Bavarian State Secretary of the Interior, Herr Dr. Schweyer, condemns to the utmost these excesses of antisemitic agitation at every opportunity that arises within the parliament and outside it.  The leader of the Democratic Party, Dr. Dirr, has also just recently given resolute expression in the Landtag to the alarm of his party over the rabble-rousing character of the placards tolerated by the Directorate of the Munich Police.  But the real political leaders of the Bavarian People’s Party, Herrs Held, Wohlmuth, Knilling, Giehrl, Stang etc., have until now maintained utter silence in the discussion of these matters, at least in the <em>Landtag.</em></blockquote>

<h4>Attacks on Zionism</h4>

   <p>On May 1, 1921, Arabs attacked a parade of Jewish workers in the port city of Jaffa in Palestine, killing dozens and injuring many more.  A week later, the Vatican newspaper ran an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii404">article</a>, “The Genesis of the Grave Disorders,” claiming Bolsheviks were infiltrating Palestine.  The Arab attack was explained as a local reaction against Jewish efforts to establish a Communist movement among the Arabs.  <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> raised the question of Zionist responsibility for the Russian Revolution and Bolshevism.
 
  <p>On June 13, 1921, Pope Benedict XV gave a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii406">speech</a> attacking Zionism in more restrained terms than those appearing in his newspaper the month before, but clearly expressing his fear that “the Jews might attain a position of preponderance and privilege in Palestine.”  The Pope expressed a concern not just for the Holy Places, but for the entire land of Palestine because it was "consecrated by the Divine Redeemer Himself.”  He went on to say,
<blockquote>It is well known, in fact, that the situation of the Christians in Palestine has not only not improved but has even become worse through the new civil ordinances put in force there which tend – if not in the intentions of those responsible for them, certainly, however, in fact – to turn Christianity out of the positions it has occupied up to now and to put Jews in its place.</blockquote>
   <p>The speech made an appeal for governments to bring pressure to bear on the League of Nations, which had not yet finalized and approved the British mandate to govern Palestine:
<blockquote>However, inasmuch as the situation in Palestine is not yet definitely regulated, We now raise Our voice that, when the time comes to establish there a permanent condition of things, to the Catholic Church and to all Christians shall be assured the inalienable rights they hold.  Certainly We have no desire that any damage shall be done to the rights of the Jewish element; what We mean is that they must in no way be put above the just rights of the Christians.  And to this end We warmly urge all the Governments of Christian nations, even if not Catholic, to bring vigilant pressure to bear on the League of Nations which, it is commonly said, is to consider and adjudicate on the English Mandate in Palestine.</blockquote>
   <p>During the months that followed, Cardinal Secretary of State Gasparri <a href="inotesii4.html#ii407">stated</a> in meetings with British officials and others that a Jewish government in Palestine was a prospect the Vatican would not tolerate.</p>

<h4>An Authoritative Promotion of Racism</h4>

   <a name="blackshame"></a><p>On August 21, 1921 the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> ran a short but intense article on a racial theme that appeared repeatedly in Nazi racist propaganda in the early 1920s:  the “black shame” of France employing African colonial troops in the occupation of the Rhineland.  Despite Catholic teaching on the unity of the human race and the evil of racism, the archdiocesan paper called the use of black troops “the greatest shame for culture of our century and perhaps of all time.”
   <p>The entire piece reads as follows:
   <blockquote>From World and Church:  The “German Emergency League Against the Black Shame” has now published the first issue of its propaganda monthly “The Shame on the Rhine.”  In eloquent and impressive words, it is shown therein how Europeans are endangered by the most frightful tropical diseases of all sorts through the occupation of European districts by colored soldiers, how white women and girls are infected with tropical syphilis and other serious venereal diseases, how white children are extremely endangered in their moral upbringing by the quartering of colored soldiers in homes of the citizenry, finally how the occupied districts are being mulatto-ized, and thereby conditions are being created whose consequences for the spiritual, cultural and physical life of the affected white nation are inconceivable.  The next issue intends to await the complete officially announced details of the period from the beginning of March to the end of May 1921. – Rise up for the moral battle against the greatest shame for culture [<em>Kulturschmach</em>] of our century and perhaps of all time, brought about by the insane policy of hatred and the phrenetic sadism of the French nation!</blockquote>
   <p>This example stands in contrast to <em>We Remember’s</em> praise of German Bishops for public opposition to Nazi racism, and the same document’s praise for Cardinal Faulhaber in particular.  Followers of the “good press” in Bavaria, as of 1921, had reason to believe that the most militant aspects of Nazi antisemitism, as well as some of the most extreme statements of Nazi racism, were in harmony with high Catholic authority in Bavaria.</p>
   
<h4>The Elimination of Matthias Erzberger</h4>

   <p>On August 26, 1921, Matthias Erzberger was assassinated by members of an extremist group headquartered in Bavaria, the <em>Organisation Consul</em>.  This group, protected by Bavarian authorities, murdered dozens of Germans whom it <a href="inotesii4.html#ii408">adjudged</a> to be “traitors” during the early 1920s.  Germans who valued democracy and peace mourned the death of Erzberger.  The Social Democratic <em>Munich Post</em> paid <a href="inotesii4.html#ii410">tribute</a> to Erzberger’s character and good humor as a political opponent and pointed to the first factor that made him a target:  “By introducing the Peace Resolution of July 1917, he brought upon himself the deadly hatred of the war instigators and warmongers …”

   <p>The Nazis <a href="inotesii4.html#ii411">rejoiced</a> openly.  Their newspaper in Munich denounced Erzberger as the “schoolmaster” who, in league with Jews, brought about the November 1918 democratic revolution in Germany.  The <em>Völkisch Observer</em> ridiculed the widespread notion that he was a martyr.  Under the headline “Treason,” a Nazi editor claimed to be a truer representative of Catholicism than Erzberger, given his collaboration with Jews in the Weimar Republic.  The murder of Erzberger certainly eliminated the strongest advocate for democracy among German Catholics, and probably the most <a href="inotesii4.html#ii412">formidable</a> German Catholic opposing antisemitism as of 1921.  The assassination occurred shortly after Erzberger announced to the Center Party his intent to return to politics.  He had spent more than a year successfully clearing himself of corruption charges that had forced him to resign as Reich Finance Minister in 1920.
   <p>On August 29, 1921, German Chancellor Wirth and the Reich Cabinet responded to the Erzberger assassination by issuing an emergency decree authorizing publication bans on newspapers and associations that incite violence against government officials or challenge the constitution and government of the Weimar Republic.  This was the Republic-Defense-Decree [<em>Republikschutz-Verordnung</em>].  Two days later, the government decreed a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii413">14-day publication ban</a> on the <em>Völkisch Observer</em>.</p>


<h4>Ups and Downs in Concordat Negotiations</h4>

   <p>On September 6, 1921, Nuncio Pacelli reported in a letter to the Bavarian Ambassador to the Vatican, Baron Otto von Ritter zu Groenesteyn, that the Bavarian Government was moving quickly toward agreement on the new concordat:  “The Bavarian Concordat negotiations will now hopefully arrive at a speedy, satisfactory conclusion.”  This was a major relief after unanticipated setbacks earlier in the year.  In four <a href="inotesii4.html#ii414">letters</a> to Baron von Ritter between March and September 1921, Pacelli credited Franz Matt, the Bavarian Minister of Education and Religion [<em>Kultusminister</em>], for his efforts to move the negotiations forward.  On November 15, 1921, Reich Chancellor Joseph Wirth agreed in a meeting with Pacelli to begin negotiations for a Concordat between the German Reich and the Vatican.

   <p>On December 4, 1921, the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> republished the Bavarian Bishops’ pastoral letter against the “bad press.”  December 4 was the Second Sunday of Advent, the day the letter was read aloud to the faithful from every Bavarian Catholic pulpits.  Nothing had been done during 1921, as far as we have found, to dispel the impression created in 1920 that the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> and its antisemitic propaganda were part of the “good press.”

   <p>On December 11, 1921, Nuncio Pacelli, in a private letter marked Strictly Confidential, informed the Bavarian Ambassador to the Vatican of a new setback for the prospects of a separate Vatican-Bavaria Concordat.  These prospects were inevitably precarious in all events, because the Weimar Republic Constitution provided that only the Reich Government could enter into treaties with foreign governments.  That ruled out a treaty between a state such as Bavaria and the Vatican, unless the Vatican was viewed as something other than a foreign government.  Based on the loss of the Papal States half a century before, Nuncio Pacelli had some prospect of finessing this issue in the early 1920s.  But a “very clumsy step,” he <a href="inotesii4.html#ii415">reported</a> to Ambassador von Ritter without further describing that step, “has aroused the most acute concern on the second floor here about a separate treaty” for Bavaria with the Vatican.

<h4>Under a New Pope, Concordat Efforts Intensify</h4>

   <p>On January 22, 1922, Pope Benedict XV died.  At the conclave that followed, Cardinal Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti, the Archbishop of Milan, was elected Pope, taking the name Pius XI (1922-1939).  Ratti had spent most of his ecclesiastical career as a librarian, first at the Church’s Ambrosian Library in Milan, then at the Vatican Library, where he eventually became head, or prefect.  In 1918, Pope Benedict and Cardinal Secretary of State Gasparri had sent him as the Vatican’s representative to the newly re-founded country of Poland.  When the Polish Government accused him of partiality to Germany and forced him to leave the country, Ratti was appointed Archbishop of Milan and elevated to Cardinal, in mid-1921.  Elected to the papacy eight months later, he retained Gasparri as Secretary of State.  

   <p>A high priority for Pope Pius XI and Cardinal Gasparri was the negotiating of concordats with many nations.  Gasparri headed the 13-year project to compile the 1917 Code of Canon Law, with Eugenio Pacelli as one of his most trusted deputies.  Gasparri and Pacelli were committed to implementing the new Canon Law, country by country, by means of concordats, a process which accelerated under Pope Pius XI.  The heightened urgency to negotiate a new concordat between Bavaria and the Vatican in early 1922, under the new Pope, can be seen in a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii416">letter</a> from Nuncio Pacelli to Bavarian Ambassador von Ritter on March 10, 1922:  “For my part I can assure you that I am certainly leaving nothing undone that is within my power, in order to bring about the speedy conclusion of a self-standing Bavarian Concordat…”

<h4>Vatican Policy Encounters Setbacks as to Concordats and Zionism</h4>

   <p>Serious obstacles to the Vatican-Bavaria Concordat arose both from the Bavarian Government and from the Reich Government.  On April 5, 1922, Bishop Mergel of Eichstätt sent Cardinal Faulhaber his comments on a recent proposed draft of the Bavaria-Vatican Concordat.  His letter suggests the degree of difficulty Faulhaber and Pacelli were experiencing with the German Reich Government, which had the power to block an international agreement between the State of Bavaria and the Vatican, even if the Vatican was not a sovereign foreign power at the time:

<blockquote>Concerning the Concordat negotiations, I deplore the continual procrastination [<em>Verschleppung</em>] and lack of straightforwardness of the Government in the North; on the one hand they cite the Weimar Constitution, on the other hand they keep taking away from the Church the freedoms that were guaranteed at Weimar …</blockquote>

   <p>On April 15, a letter from Nuncio Pacelli to Ambassador von Ritter described the severity of the problems he was encountering at the level of the Bavarian State Government, despite the best efforts of Education and Religion Minister Franz Matt:

<blockquote>Concerning the Concordat negotiations, the last part of the response from Herr Kultusminister Matt (of whose upright intentions I have not the slightest doubt) on Points XII, XIII, XIV and XV was an almost complete rejection, and has consequently also made a painful impression on our much-beloved Lord Cardinal.  I have nevertheless not lost heart ... </blockquote>

   <p>The original <a href="inotesii4.html#ii417">letters</a> from Pacelli to Ritter are preserved in the Bavarian Main State Archive.  The letter from Bishop Mergel to Cardinal Faulhaber can be found in the Munich Archdiocese Archive and in a published collection of Faulhaber’s papers.

   <p>On May 20, 1922, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii418">article</a> entitled “Zionism According to the Opinions of the Jews.”  The topics it treated can be seen in the summary at the head of the article:  
<blockquote>The old aspirations of the Jews resuscitated by new propaganda.  A conference in Rome on Zionism.  Reasons, discussions. - I.  Precursors of the idea.  Political Zionism proposed by Theodore Herzl. - II. Early enthusiasms: Congress of Basel: diplomatic actions. - III.  Financial difficulties: internal contradictions.  The proposal for Uganda.  Death of Herzl. - IV. New colonial location.  The war opens new hopes. The declaration of the English government. - V. The British Mandate for Palestine.  Immigration: Jewish culture. - VI. Financial assistance: Jewish hopes and visions.</blockquote>

<p>The article invoked the words of the Pope from a year before, arguing that all Catholics have an obligation to prevent Jews from gaining control of the holy places.  <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> did not specify whether the "holy places" were a limited set of particular sites or, as in the Pope's formulation in 1921, the entire land:

<blockquote>Our readers will not have forgotten how the Roman Pontiff intervened with his august words to remember the rights of Christians over the places of Palestine that were consecrated by the presence of the divine redeemer: and all Catholics must take to heart the protection of the holy places that has always been for their fathers a tradition of faith and honor.</blockquote>

   <p>On June 3, 1922, Nuncio Pacelli <a href="inotesii4.html#ii420">wrote</a> to Ambassador von Ritter that Church authorities in Rome did not sufficiently recognize the difficulties of negotiating a Concordat with Bavaria, which they presumed to be a good Catholic state.  Cardinal Faulhaber had just returned from Rome, where he tried to have an “enlightening impact” on them.  While Rome appeared to believe a successful conclusion was readily achievable, this was not the case.  Now Pacelli was waiting for instructions from Rome, which would guide his future course in everything related to the Concordat. 

<blockquote>With yearning I await instructions from there, to which I attribute the greatest importance, because they must serve as my guidelines for everything further.  I have also gained the impression from various symptoms that in Rome the difficulties are not sufficiently recognized, though I have not failed always and ever again to direct attention to them.  That comes apparently from the well-known good reputation that “Catholic Bavaria” enjoys in Rome.  In any event I consider it fortunate that His Eminence [Cardinal Faulhaber] sojourned in the Eternal City precisely in these decisive days and could have an enlightening impact.  I am allowing myself, moreover, no illusions about the future:  We are not yet at the end, as they appear to believe there.  All the more, however, I am working for the great and far-reaching work, which shall also be a model for other German states ...</blockquote>

   <p>On June 22, 1922, Hitler gave a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii421">speech</a> proclaiming the mission of the German <em>Volk</em> to be the destruction of Bolshevism, and with it the Jews.  A passage in this speech foreshadowed Hitler’s later proclamation of the Third Reich, the successor to the Roman Reich of the German Nation:

   <blockquote>Bolshevism is the final consequence of materialistic Marxism.  To stamp it out is the mission of the German <em>Volk</em>.  The goal:  The Germanic Reich of the German Nation.  The swastika on our flag leads the triumphal procession.  Under the word of truth we will unite everything good against our mortal enemy:  the Jews!</blockquote>

   <p>On June 30, 1922, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> published a diplomatic note sent by Cardinal Secretary of State Gasparri to the League of Nations in May, protesting key terms of the British Mandate to govern Palestine, which was pending approval by the League.  Gasparri’s note protested against (a) the Jews being given a "privileged and preponderant position in Palestine,” (b) the religious rights of Christians being “inadequately safeguarded,” (c) the recognition of a Jewish agency for development of the country, and (d) favorable terms for immigration and naturalization of Jews.  The Vatican newspaper said the League of Nations was paying close attention to the Vatican’s position, and Catholic public opinion worldwide should accordingly be mobilized.  “To this end a Catholic international may be established, which would unite all Catholics in the world in the defense of the Holy Places and against Bolshevik Judaism in Palestine.”

   <p>On July 10, 1922, Cardinal Faulhaber explained to all the Bavarian Bishops the import of his recent meetings in Rome.  In a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii422">letter</a> to the Bishops, Faulhaber said the political realities in Bavaria made it impossible to achieve the type of concordat Rome wanted:   

<blockquote>My recent trip to Rome for the International Eucharistic Congress, at which the German episcopate was notably weakly represented, was occasioned by a particularly urgent invitation at the last hour, and perhaps as it turned out for good reason, because there commenced at the same time (namely Sunday, May 28th) the decisive session of the Roman Cardinals Commission on the draft of the Bavarian Concordat.  With every single one of the members of this Commission, I was able to talk before the session and explain to them that even in Bavaria, which they imagined to be a purely Catholic province, the composition of the state parliament and the overall political situation make it impossible to attain a Concordat built solely on the principles of Canon Law without any concessions, so that, to our regret, we cannot hope to put through a Bavarian Concordat that will be a master template for such as Belgium and Poland.  In general the recommendations of the Bavarian episcopate, which were already known via the report of the Nunciature, came off as the most practical, while some members of the Commission made no secret that the demands of the cathedral chapters could endanger the whole Concordat.</blockquote>

   <p>On July 15, 1922, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii424">sequel</a> to its May 20 article, entitled “Zionism According to the Opinions of Non-Jews.”  The direction of the article can be seen in its opening summary:

<blockquote>I. Zionism prejudices the rights of the Arab population that has possessed Palestine for so many centuries. - II. England is violating the treaty in which it gave Palestine to the Sheriff of Mecca. - III. The Allies promised the Arabs independence and the option of having their own government. - IV. Zionist abuses and overbearingness against the population in order to found the State of Israel. - V. Arab resentment: appeal to England with adverse results. - VI. Turmoils: protests: threats and dangers for the future. - VII. Union of all the inhabitants of Palestine against Jewish predominance in Palestine. - VIII. A vote in the House of Lords</blockquote>

   <p>The article equated Jewish immigrants in Palestine with “the most extreme Bolshevik communism,” using language that openly excused, and could be used to justify, violence:  

<blockquote>No one is surprised that the Arabs, seeing how resorting to the peaceful path of legal remonstrations served them nothing, would lose their patience and let themselves be dragged into the path of violence… 

<p>Against all this filth that dishonors Palestine and the Arabs, and more, the Christian population protests, and they suffer the abuses of power and the oppressions with which the Jews arrogantly tyrannize the country … 

<p>The common danger has already united the Christian and Muslim populations in a defensive league for the rights of their own existence …</blockquote>

   <p>This article was published at the height of the Vatican’s efforts to mobilize opposition to the British mandate, which had been submitted for approval at the League of Nations earlier in the year.  The institutionalized review process of the Vatican Secretary of State over <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> ensured that the content of the article was consistent with Vatican policy.  In the face of Cardinal Gasparri’s note of May, the determined Vatican opposition to the mandate as drafted, and behind-the-scenes efforts to mobilize countries with Catholic populations against the mandate, the League of Nations nonetheless approved the British mandate for Palestine on July 24, 1922.

<h4>Tensions Mount Between the Bavarian Government and the German Reich Government</h4>

   <p>On July 22, 1922, a new “Republic Defense Law” [<em>Republikschutzgesetz</em>] went into effect in Germany, in response to the assassination four weeks earlier of German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau.   Rathenau, a Jewish German industrialist who opposed Zionism in favor of assimilation, was murdered by the same <em>Organisation Consul</em> group that killed Matthias Erzberger.   The Republic Defense Law not only addressed political violence, but also verbal and written attacks on the constitutional form of government, efforts to bring back the monarchy, and associational ties with persons or entities engaged in <em>Hochverrat</em> – high treason.  The State Government of Bavaria, where the Nazi Party, <em>Organisation Consul</em> and some other groups dedicated to overthrowing the Weimar Republic were based, refused to cooperate in enforcing the new law.  Instead, it enacted a Bavarian Emergency Decree as a counter-measure.
   <p>On July 23, 1922, Nuncio Pacelli <a href="inotesii4.html#ii425">reported</a> to Cardinal Gasparri in Rome about the position of German Reich Chancellor Joseph Wirth, a Catholic and member of the Center Party, toward a Vatican-Germany Concordat.  Wirth had told Pacelli it was impossible to propose in the Reichstag the type of concordat the Vatican desired.  As Chancellor from May 1921 until November 1922, Wirth was identified, like Erzberger, with the democratic and labor-oriented wing of the Center Party.
   <p>On August 12, 1922 a compromise agreement was initially announced between the Reich Government and the Bavarian State Government.  Bavaria purportedly agreed to accept the Republic Defense Law, and the Reich Government agreed to respect the rights of the states.  Fritz Gerlich’s <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii426">covered</a> this agreement on the front page.

   <p>On August 16, 1922, Hitler addressed a crowd estimated at 50,000 to 70,000 on the <a href="inotesii4.html#ii428"><em>Königsplatz</em></a>, the “King’s Plaza,” in Munich.  The motto of the assembly was “For Germany – Against Berlin,” referring to the ongoing struggle between Bavaria and the Weimar Republic over the Reich Defense Law.  The Nazis directed their event expressly against “the Jewish-Bolshevism that is advancing under the protection of the Republic.”  In Hitler’s <a href="inotesii4.html#ii429">words</a>:

   <blockquote>In Berlin they live to look after Eastern Jewish Bolshevism ... the yoke of another has been placed on our neck.  The cabinet ministers of today will be gone one day, but the yoke will continue to oppress 60 million Germans.  We long for a decision by the <em>Volk</em> on this vital issue of our time.</blockquote> 

<p>On August 17, the day after the mass gathering on the Königsplatz, the <em>Münchner Neueste Nachrichten</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii427">reported</a> that the Bavarian People’s Party now refused to accept the compromise agreement between Bavaria and the Reich Government concerning the Republic Defense Law.  That same day, Hitler addressed a large audience at Munich’s Krone Circus.  He denounced the Weimar Republic as a “contradiction to Germany from the outset” and attacked the mainstream press of Germany as “the Jewish press,” declaring: “The incitement against Bavaria in the Berlin Jewish press must stop.”  Hitler’s words were <a href="inotesii4.html#ii430">reported</a> in the Munich press.

<p>The degree of tension between Bavarian authorities and the Weimar Republic at this point can also be seen in the relationship between Cardinal Faulhaber of Munich and Reich Chancellor Wirth.  With the annual nationwide Catholic Congress scheduled to be held in Munich in late August, Faulhaber let Wirth know that he was not welcome to attend.  Wirth responded with a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii430a">letter</a> on August 21, 1922, complaining of irresponsible demagoguery in the main Catholic daily paper of Bavaria, and speaking of the dangers of political violence in Bavaria:

<blockquote>As I hear it, Your Eminence considers it advisable that I not take part in the German Catholic Congress this year.  I am also of the view that considering the dominant mood in Bavaria I should keep away from the upcoming Congress, - not as if I had concern for my own life, but rather because I consider it my duty to spare our Fatherland the unrest that would be the inevitable consequence of a nonetheless possible attempt on my life.  I cannot conceal, however, that it is a deeply distressing feeling for me as a Catholic that the Catholic Chancellor of the German Reich cannot attend the German Catholic Congress, because the mood of the province in which it will be held has been whipped up to such an extent.

<p>Of Your Eminence, as Bavaria’s highest Bishop, might I venture to request that you take a stand, with whatever means you will and can, against this mood among the Catholic population of your province, which I for the good of our Fatherland must denounce as extremely injurious.</blockquote>

<p>Also on August 21, 1922, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg began a visit to Munich, including a visit to the <em>Frauenkirche</em>, the Catholic Cathedral.  Hindenberg’s meetings over several days included Cardinal Faulhaber, Gustav von Kahr and Prince Rupprecht, the senior member of the Bavaria’s former royal family.  On August 23, the <em>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</em> reported that the parties of the Bavarian state governing coalition, which included the Catholic Bavarian People’s Party, had accepted the August 12 compromise agreement, and the Bavarian Emergency Decree would be lifted.

<h4>Munich’s Cardinal-Archbishop Speaks Out</h4>

   <p>On August 27, 1922, Cardinal Faulhaber took up Wirth’s challenge to “take a stand.”  The Cardinal’s <a href="inotesii4.html#ii431">words</a> to a crowd of 100,000 gathered on the <em>Königsplatz</em> for the opening Sunday mass of the Catholic Congress embraced two central Nazi themes:  denial of the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic, and denunciation of the democratic-oriented mainstream press of Germany as the “Jewish press.”  Faulhaber declared that the Revolution of November 1918, which transformed the country from monarchy to democracy, was “perjury and high treason,” and that “it remains in history congenitally tainted and branded with the mark of Cain.”  The relevant passage of Faulhaber’s remarks reads as follows in English:
<blockquote>Compromises are unavoidable in the interplay of oppositions and interests.  Superior to all compromises, however, are principles, like the eternal stars, and there comes a limit where we say: Up to here and no further!  The Revolution was perjury and high treason, and it remains in history congenitally tainted and branded with the mark of Cain.  Even if the upheaval brought some successes, even if it opened the way for adherents of the Catholic faith to higher offices far more than before, - its moral character is not assessed by its results, for a misdeed may not be sanctified on the basis of its results.</blockquote>
<p>Faulhaber thus signaled to 100,000 Catholics, in the birthplace of Nazism, that extremist opposition to German democracy was the way of Catholic principle. Hitler could not have gained more authoritative support in Bavaria for his programmatic attack on the Weimar Republic.  In defying the German Government, Cardinal Faulhaber led Catholics away from the German Catholic political tradition of Wirth, Erzberger and the Center Party, and into Nazi-friendly policy as a matter of “principle.”  
<p>The same dynamic can be seen with respect to antisemitism.  Faulhaber had remained behind the scenes in 1920 as his archdiocesan newspaper promoted militant antisemitism, but now he came out in the open.  His use of the phrase “the mark of Cain” was a powerful invocation of a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii432">traditional antisemitic epithet</a>.  His use of the phrase “the Jewish press of Berlin” was a direct match with Hitler’s reported turn of phrase from the week before.  Faulhaber couched his attack on the “Jewish press,” moreover, in the same terms as the Nazi Party Program.  Point 23 of that program began, “We demand a legal war on verifiable lies and their promulgation by the press,” and continued by demanding exclusion of Jews from the press.  Faulhaber’s speech demanded the application of the <a href="inotesii4.html#ii434">Eighth Commandment</a>, “Thou shalt not lie,” against the Jewish press of Berlin.
<p>Faulhaber’s speech defied the Republic Defense Law, with its prohibitions on verbal attacks on the constitution, by accusing the Weimar Republic itself of high treason.  A newspaper in Ingolstadt, north of Munich, <a href="inotesii4.html#ii436">exhorted</a> the authorities to enforce the Republic Defense Law against Faulhaber for attacking the constitution and government officials.  But the Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich proved to be untouchable.  Konrad Adenauer, the Mayor of Cologne and later Chancellor of Germany (1949-1963), applied some mild and tactful <a href="inotesii4.html#ii437">words</a>, in his capacity as President of the Catholic Congress of 1922, to temper the effect of Faulhaber’s remarks on the crowd.  While some Center Party delegates and newspapers joined in criticizing the Cardinal, Faulhaber received the private backing of Pope Pius XI, while Adenauer received a strong rebuke from Baron Cramer-Klett, one of Nuncio Pacelli’s closest friends in Bavaria.  In a private <a href="inotesii4.html#ii438">letter</a> exemplifying the deference Cardinal Faulhaber enjoyed in Bavaria, Cramer-Klett expressed his
<blockquote>astonishment that from Catholic sources such things are said about this man which are designed to diminish his respect and his influence, and which certainly will be taken in that manner.  You forget that this man is the Archbishop of a great Diocese, a successor of the Apostles and a Cardinal of the Roman Church, before whom every Catholic, including a member of the Center Party, should have reverence and respect.</blockquote>
   <p>In a Church that taught submission to governmental as well as ecclesiastical authority and <a href="inotesii4.html#ii440">proclaimed indifference</a> between monarchical and democratic forms of government, Cardinal Faulhaber’s remarks were extraordinary, however great the deference he might receive from Catholics and others in Bavaria.  Nuncio Pacelli was present when Faulhaber spoke, as Pacelli was the <a href="inotesii4.html#ii441">main celebrant</a> of the mass on the Königsplatz, but we have found no original or secondary source indicating his personal view of the Cardinal’s remarks.  
   <p>Significantly, Faulhaber’s August 1922 words about the origins of the Weimar Republic were far different from the stance he took at the time of the November 1918 Revolution.  Two weeks after the Revolution produced the abdication of all German monarchs and the establishment of federal and state republics, Faulhaber <a href="inotesii4.html#ii442">instructed</a> the clergy of the Archdiocese of Munich that they were "obligated by conscience" to support the now-existing order.  Even though the new German and Bavarian governments immediately launched policies that Faulhaber strongly opposed, such as separation of Church and State and challenges to Church control of government-funded schools, Faulhaber <a href="inotesii4.html#ii443">responded</a> by mobilizing Catholics against such measures by democratic means, such as public demonstrations and votes against the ruling political party in the Bavarian elections of January 1919. Faulhaber instructed his priests to preach on the theme "the Church above the changes of the times." Catholics, in sum, must look to their Church leaders for guidance as events unfold in a challenging time. Four years later, in 1922, the guidance from the highest Church authority in Bavaria changed, into an open challenge to the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic.  In a Bavaria where a steadily growing Nazi Party was devoted to overthrowing that Republic and the “Jewish press” which supported democratic government, Cardinal Faulhaber's words pointed German Catholics in the direction of Nazi tenets and Nazi initiatives. 

<p>While Cardinal Faulhaber claimed privately to Chancellor Wirth and to the Vatican that he was only attacking the 1918 Revolution, not the present-day Weimar Republic and its constitution, he said nothing <em>in public</em> to change the impression that he was condemning the Weimar Republic. The Catholic priest who edited Faulhaber's papers and wrote extensively about his life, Ludwig Volk, comments that Faulhaber's after-the-fact claim of attacking just the Revolution and not the Weimar Republic was "decidedly too convoluted to be convincing." He adds: "There was nothing the Revolution's mark of Cain could have applied to hereditarily other than the Revolution's offspring, the Weimar State." Certainly the Nazis recognized at the time that Cardinal Faulhaber had given great credibility to their attack on the German Government, and to their racial antisemitic propaganda, as well as undermining the credibility of the Center Party and its leaders among Catholics.   The Nazi newspaper in Munich proceeded to take full propaganda advantage of the Cardinal's remarks.

<h4>The Nazis Capitalize on Cardinal Faulhaber’s Words</h4>

   <p>On August 30, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> ran <a href="inotesii4.html#ii444">two pieces</a> about the Catholic Congress.  The first contrasted Cardinal Faulhaber’s words about perjury, treason and continuing taint with another German Cardinal’s previous exhortation to honor and obey the existing government, no matter how it came into existence.  “Now who is right?  Of these two views, only one can be the official Catholic one.”  This article also highlighted Cardinal Faulhaber’s call to enforce the commandment “thou shalt not lie” against "the Jewish press of Berlin" and "its Munich correspondents."  In the second article, Nazi editor and ideologist Alfred Rosenberg used the Catholic Congress as an occasion to expound in detail about <em>Völkisch</em> ideology and criticize Catholic efforts to sharpen denominational differences among Germans.  Rosenberg noted Cardinal Faulhaber’s “remarkable” use of the phrase “Catholics of pure-racial type” at two points in his speech. According to Rosenberg, Faulhaber added that "this is to be taken in no event as 'German-Catholic.'"
   <p>On September 2, 1922, its next issue, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> gave <a href="inotesii4.html#ii446">front page coverage</a> to Faulhaber’s remarks.  The paper crowed that Faulhaber was now saying what the Nazis had been saying all along, denouncing the “Jewish press” and condemning Weimar democracy. Emphasizing Faulhaber's adoption of Nazi antisemitic rhetoric about "world finance," the paper rejoiced in his denunciation of the League of Nations as a "gambling-hell of big capitalism." The <em>Völkisch Observer</em> supposed that the Cardinal’s remarks were surely not just a spontaneous personal utterance, but must have been “the fruit of thorough discussion among leaders.”  In light of Faulhaber’s personal stance <em>against</em> challenging the new order in 1918, and Pope Pius XI’s support of Faulhaber’s August 27 remarks, the <em>Observer’s</em> supposition cannot be readily dismissed as unfounded. Moreover, denouncing the League of Nations was a high-profile matter of international policy. “In any case,” the paper said, “it is now established that the head of the Church hierarchy has placed himself behind the <em>Völkisch</em> critique.”
   <p>The <em>Völkisch Observer</em> also showed its awareness of a factor that was likely also on the minds of some Catholics at the time.  August 26th, the day before Cardinal Faulhaber addressed the faithful on the <em>Königsplatz</em>, was the one-year anniversary of the assassination of the most influential Catholic politician in post-war Germany, Matthias Erzberger.  If the November 1918 Revolution was perjury and high treason, then Erzberger, the leading peace advocate in Germany, who negotiated and signed the Armistice of November 11, 1918 on behalf of the Revolutionary Government, and who led the Catholic Center Party to participate in that Government, was certainly the most conspicuous Catholic among the “perjurors” and “traitors.”  For Catholics who accepted Cardinal Faulhaber’s words, that meant Erzberger got what he deserved.  The editors of the Nazi paper, who thought all along that Erzberger got what he deserved, assigned him a mock-noble title as they <a href="inotesii4.html#ii447">described</a> the Cardinal’s condemnation of the political system Erzberger helped establish:  “Matthias von Biberach.”  Biberach was the place where Erzberger’s bullet-ridden body had been buried the year before.
 
     <p>On September 18, 1922, Hitler spoke to a crowd of 7,000 at the Krone Circus and called for a day of reckoning against the Weimar Republic.  Hitler used the concepts of treason and Jewish dominance to build a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii448">case for action</a>:
 
  <blockquote>Settling of accounts with the November Criminals of 1918 (minutes-long roaring applause).  It cannot be that two million Germans fell in vain and yet later they sit down amicably at the table with traitors.  No, we do not forgive, rather <em>we</em> demand – retaliation!
  <p>The dishonoring of our nation has to come to an end.  Traitors to the Fatherland and collaborators belong on the gallows.  Our streets and plazas should once again bear the names of our heroes and not be named for Jews.  The issue of guilt must be pronounced according to the truth.</blockquote>

<p>On September 23, 1922, Hitler sharpened his call to action against the Weimar Republic, in an appeal published on the front page of the <em>Völkisch Observer</em>.  Repeatedly denouncing the “Jewish press,” Hitler exhorted the <em>Observer’s</em> readership:
   <blockquote>If the Jew believes he can conquer, then we want to show that the Germanic skull is harder than his, and that a <em>Volk</em> for whose existence two million died on the field of battle, can yet summon up the means to avenge those who were cheated of their lives abroad and whose deaths were made futile for our Fatherland by deceivers and criminals...
   <p>The National Socialist movement shall represent the combat troops for the liberation of our German <em>Volk</em> from the fetters of its international world-enslavement.  Its intellectual sword shall be its press.  Its material weapons the self-sacrificial willingness of its adherents...
   <p>Arise for battle for our deeply beloved German <em>Volk</em> and Fatherland!</blockquote>

<p>It was less than a month from Faulhaber's condemnation of the Weimar Republic to Hitler's summoning of a Nazi military force to overthrow it. The authority of the Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich made it possible for Hitler to direct his insurrectionary appeals to Bavaria's Catholic population, with credibility. Beginning in September 1922, Hitler's speeches and the Nazi Party's actions showed the impact of Faulhaber's Königsplatz speech. From this point on, Hitler and the Nazis directed their efforts to develop a <em>military</em> force - not just a crowd of cheering enthusiasts in beer halls - to bring a violent day of reckoning to those whom he, like the Cardinal, branded traitors, criminals, and "Jewish press."</p>

<h4>Cardinal Faulhaber Stands by His Words While the Nazis Continue to Capitalize on Them</h4>

   <p>During September 1922, Cardinal Faulhaber <a href="inotesii4.html#ii450">explained</a> to Chancellor Wirth, and to Archbishop Pizzardo <a href="inotesii4.html#ii451">at the Vatican</a>, that he did not intend to attack the Weimar Constitution or Government, only the Revolution of November 1918. Faulhaber asserted his right, and his responsibility as a Bishop, to condemn the Revolution as a violation of God's Commandments:

<blockquote>If a Catholic Bishop may no longer preach about the Ten Commandments of God and condemn the Revolution and assess historical events according to the standard of the eternal Decalogue rather than according to the Revolution’s fortuitous day-to-day consequences and other inessential appendages, - then who in all the world should distinguish light from darkness!</blockquote>

<p>Cardinal Faulhaber explained to Chancellor Wirth that Cardinals meeting in Rome, who previously viewed Germany with favor, had come to regard the country by May 1922 as "the forerunner and ally of Bolshevism." Thus the Weimar Republic, under the leadership of a Catholic Chancellor, was now viewed in Rome as an enemy rather than a friend. Faulhaber asked Archbishop Pizzardo in Rome to ensure "that no Papal pronouncement might ensue that could be interpreted by Catholics as agreement with the policy of the Center Party," and that Catholic Congress President Adenauer "cannot receive the Papal order that was customary previously for Presidents." Not surprisingly, Wirth's government fell less than two months later. The key to his removal was the withdrawal of support by the Catholic Bavarian People's Party in the Reichstag.

<p>Though Faulhaber's <em>private</em> correspondence disclaimed any intent to condemn the present-day Weimar Republic, it appears the Cardinal did nothing <em>publicly</em> to dispel the impression that he actually was condemning the current German government as "congenitally tainted" and "marked with the sign of Cain." As far as we can determine, Cardinal Faulhaber never retracted, or publicly modified, any of his words from the Catholic Congress.  A <a href="inotesii4.html#ii452">letter</a> from Faulhaber to the Bavarian Bishops stated that Pope Pius XI fully supported his words to the Catholic Congress:  “The Holy Father, who knows the entire content of my speech, has expressed to me his full agreement.”

<p>Cardinal Faulhaber's September 19, 1922 letter to Archbishop Pizzardo praised Nuncio Pacelli and emphasized the importance of cultivating loyalty to Rome among German Catholics:

<blockquote>there needed to be once again a principled explication not only of the German-ness, but rather also the Catholic-ness of German Catholics.  And really clear and concrete, not in diplomatic speech, so that the people understand the principles:  We are not merely German citizens, 
we are by grace children of the supranational world Church.  Most Reverend Lord Apostolic Nuncio Pacelli, by his glorious, powerfully expressed speech in flawless German, contributed essentially to the success of the Catholic Congress and aroused great enthusiasm for the Holy Father.</blockquote> 
  
   <p>When a new Bavarian monarchist party formed in September, the American Vice Consul in Munich, Robert Murphy, <a href="inotesii4.html#ii453">expected</a> the Bavarian anti-Weimar movement to take a monarchist path toward restoration of the Wittelsbach dynasty.  But that was not Faulhaber’s goal. He <a href="inotesii4.html#ii453a">explained</a> to Bavaria's ambassador to the Vatican, Baron von Ritter zu Groenestyn, that his remarks at the Catholic Congress had "carefully avoided" any "monarchical statements."  The <a href="inotesii4.html#ii454">minutes</a> of the Bavarian Bishops' meeting of September 1922 show Faulhaber's personal emphasis on the Vatican’s goal of concluding the new Concordat with Bavaria. Also, as Faulhaber explained to Archbishop Pizzardo, "I wanted to awaken consciences, because now with deliberations over the School Law and Concordat it must be proven whether or not principles stand higher than mandates and cabinet minister positions." Faulhaber, at this point in time, considered Wirth and other Center Party ministers unhelpful for achieving the Concordat. His careful avoidance of pro-monarchy statements shows he did not view the House of Wittelsbach as his path to the Concordat. Yet his careful calibration of public statements had room for a public embrace of Nazi tenets. For reasons never explored by any historian we have found, Cardinal Faulhaber, with Nuncio Pacelli at his side, treated the Nazi movement more favorably than the Catholic Center Party or the Bavarian Royal House, as these key representatives of Rome strove for the Concordat.

 
   <p>Meanwhile, on September 23, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii456">reminded</a> readers yet again of Faulhaber’s words about the “Jewish press,” quoted another German Bishop's vicious attack on Zionists, and reflected yet further on Faulhaber's words impugning the conduct of the Center Party and the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic.  Hitler and the Nazi paper continued to play on the theme of the criminal, traitorous nature of the Weimar Republic in the following months.  The <em>Observer’s</em> article of September 23 purported to stand with Cardinal Faulhaber in his main remarks, while accusing Munich’s largest Catholic daily newspaper, the <em>Bayrischer Kurier</em>, of being an organ of the “Jewish press.”  We found no evidence in fall 1922 that Cardinal Faulhaber did anything to dispel the impression that the Nazi paper was more in line with his policy views than the Catholic daily. 

<h4><em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> Publishes a Major Promotion of the Jewish-Bolshevik Conspiracy Theory</h4>

   <a name="worldrev"></a><p>On October 21, 1922, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii457">detailed promotion</a> of the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory, “World Revolution and the Jews.”  The article was filled with purported facts about the predominance of Jews in various governing and administrative councils of Soviet Russia.  The degree of exaggeration in the article can be seen in this passage about a supposed master list of upper level officials in the Russian Communist government:
<blockquote>Now in that list of more than 545 names of the holders of the governing offices of the State, citizens of Russian ethnicity are not more than 30: those of the Jewish race are a striking 447; the rest are scattered among Latvians, Finns, Germans, Armenians, Poles and other peoples that made up the Russian empire.</blockquote>
   <p>A further examination of the swastika blessing photograph in the <em>Stürmer</em>, 13 years later, illustrates the peril of allowing a dangerous lie to go uncorrected in an influential publication.  The same 447 figure, with the 545 figure rounded up to 550, <a href="inotesii4.html#ii458">appeared</a>  in the <em>Stürmer</em> under the headline “Who Governs Russia?”
   <p>The concluding paragraph of the <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> article of October 1922 included a reference to “sages,” a common alternative translation of “elders” in the title of the <em>Protocols</em>:  
   <blockquote>How to explain this strange reversal of things, this calculated eruption, sages who take over unfailingly all the organs and machinery of society, so that one can say that in Russia – a unique example – the <a href="inotesii4.html#ii459">yoke of another nation, the Jews</a>, has been imposed on the Slavs?</blockquote>

<h4>The Nazi Party Prepares an Aggressive Business Plan</h4>

   <p>On October 22, 1922, a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii461">significant Nazi Party document</a> was authored, which came to light only after Hitler’s unsuccessful Putsch the following year.  Entitled “Expansion of the National Socialist German Workers Party,” it resembles a business plan and fundraising memorandum, detailing two steps to build a force capable of defending the <em>Volk</em>, the Fatherland, and the German economy in a coming battle against “the Jewish-Marxist terror.”   One step was a well-funded expansion of the twice-weekly <em>Völkisch Observer</em> into a daily newspaper intended to serve as a powerful propaganda weapon.  The other step was an even better-funded expansion of the SA into a well-equipped force with weapons, transport and uniforms.  Explaining the need for these steps, the memorandum described a life-and-death struggle between Bolshevism and “the entire Christian-Western culture.”  Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw<a href="inotesii4.html#ii462"> comments on this document</a>, “By now Marxism and the Jew were synonymous in Hitler’s mind.”

<p>Hitler's verbal initiative of September 1922, calling for a Nazi military force to overthrow the recently-condemned Weimar Republic, had become a concrete action plan just one month later. Cardinal Faulhaber's <em>private</em> denial of intent to attack the Weimar Republic had no identifiable impact on the <em>public</em> impression that he had indeed condemned it as illegitimate. Any obedient Catholic, reading only the "good press," had ample reason to believe that the highest authority of his Church had justified an armed movement to overthrow a government of traitors and criminals, branded with the "mark of Cain." Bavarian Catholics in fact joined the Nazi movement from this point forward in far greater numbers than before. Perceptive, well-informed Catholic authorities in 1922, moreover, had at least as much reason as Ian Kershaw decades later, to know that any support for a Nazi "mission" against Marxism was understood by Hitler as a mission against Jews.</p> 

<h4>Fascism Comes to Power in Italy and Hitler Gains a Role Model</h4>

   <p>In late October 1922, Benito Mussolini became Prime Minister of Italy following a march on Rome with his black-shirted stormtroops.  Hitler viewed Mussolini as the main role model for his own fascist-nationalist efforts in Germany.  With the encouragement of Mussolini’s successful example in Italy, combined with the endorsement of the highest Catholic authority in Bavaria for the themes of criminal origin and Jewish domination of the Weimar Republic, Hitler now moved rapidly to expand the Nazi Party in Bavaria into a formidable force that could contemplate overthrowing the democratic government of Germany.

    <p>The sudden emergence of Hitler and the Nazi Party as a force in Bavaria can be seen in U.S. Vice Consul Murphy’s situation reports from Munich.  Though Murphy had been reporting regularly from Munich during 1922, the Nazi Party apparently did not merit his attention until October of that year.  After a mention that month of Nazis using clubs and blackjacks in a brawl with Socialists, Murphy focused twice in November on Hitler, the “Bavarian Mussolini” and “leader of the National Socialist blackjack’ squad.”  <a href="inotesii4.html#ii463">Murphy's situation report</a> in late November described the “greatly fortified” strength of Hitler and identified the main features of his movement:  “his campaign against the Jews,” his “avowed ultimate aim of becoming dictator” and his “condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles.”

   <p>On December, 20, 1922, two provocative pieces about Catholicism and Nazism appeared in the <em>Völkisch Observer</em>.  The first quoted a Catholic priest from Nuremberg saying the Catholic people and priesthood “will not stand so very far from the National Socialists, if the time comes.”  The second, on the same page, reported a criticism by Cardinal Faulhaber of the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> for mocking the Christian cross.  The Nazi newspaper responded in detail to Faulhaber, trying to justify the swastika as an acceptable symbol among Christians.  This is the first instance we found of Cardinal Faulhaber criticizing the Nazi newspaper by name with respect to any of its content.  He did not appear to raise objections to other aspects of Nazism, including those conspicuous enough at this time to be reported by Murphy, and those that derived force and credibility from Faulhaber’s own words of August.

<h4>Church Authority Guides Catholic Consciences</h4>
 
  <p>On December 23, 1922, Pope Pius XI issued the first encyclical of his pontificate. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_23121922_ubi-arcano-dei-consilio_en.html"><em>Ubi Arcano</em></a> instructed Catholics to look to the leaders of their Church for guidance that would be the sure path to international peace:

   <blockquote>Since the Church is the safe and sure guide to conscience, for to her safe-keeping alone there has been confided the doctrines and the promise of the assistance of Christ, she is able not only to bring about at the present hour a peace that is truly the peace of Christ, but can, better than any other agency which We know of, contribute greatly to the securing of the same peace for the future, to the making impossible of war in the future. (para. 44)</blockquote> 

   <p>Thus, as 1922 came to a close, Bavarian Catholics were faced with a Cardinal-Archbishop whose words had become a battle cry for the rapidly growing Nazi movement, who was correcting the Nazis publicly about respect for the cross but not about antisemitism or counter-revolutionary violence, and who enjoyed the full support of the Pope, who in turn was instructing all Catholics worldwide that they must look to the Church alone in order to know what is right and wrong.  The potential to lead Catholics and others into evil became increasingly manifest over the next year. 

<h4>The Rapid Rise of the Nazi Party in 1923</h4>

   <p>On January 3, 1923, a front page banner headline in the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> proclaimed: “Our Mission for 1923.”  That mission included an “enormous strengthening” of the Nazi movement for the purpose of “running out the entire band of criminals.”  A banner headline on January 13th continued the theme:  “Down with the November Criminals!”  Hitler biographer <a href="inotesii4.html#ii465">Ian Kershaw</a> observes that the phrase “November Criminals” had been used by Hitler before late 1922 and was henceforth “seldom far from his lips.”
   <p>In January, February and March of 1923, Vice Consul Murphy’s <a href=inotesii4.html#ii467">reports</a> focused extensively on the newly significant Nazi Party.  His January 14 report began by saying the Nazi Party of Hitler, the “self-styled Bavarian Mussolini, has been most in the public eye,” having previously developed recognition “by the use of enormous red placards posted in conspicuous places throughout the city.”  As to their platform, “the principal plank seems to be anti-Semitism.”  Hitler has “unquestionably raised funds from industrial circles… He is said to have declared that his anti-Semitic views are merely for advertising purpose …”
   On February 2, 1923, Murphy recounted how Hitler prevailed over Bavarian Government prohibitions on his planned Nazi Party convention in Munich.  Fearing a coup by the Nazis, the Government banned outdoor assemblies and limited Hitler to six indoor meetings.  When Hitler insisted on outdoor meetings plus twelve simultaneous indoor gatherings, threatening violence if refused, the Government yielded.  The result was a three-day Nazi convention in late January which “filled to overflowing twelve large halls.”  Murphy reported that a monarchist-oriented police chief and Gustav von Kahr were influential in leading the Government to back down to Hitler’s demands.
   <p>On February 3, 1923, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> published a prominent <a href="inotesii4.html#ii468">notice</a> announcing its expansion into a daily newspaper.  “The newspaper of the Völkisch freedom movement must receive help from all of you so that the ‘<em>Völkisch Observer</em>’ becomes the leading paper and the most feared weapon.”  Step one of the Nazi Party’s business plan of October 22, 1922 was reaching fulfillment.  Step two, to judge from Murphy’s report of March 3, was progressing as well:  “the Hitler storm troops (Sturmtruppen) which are estimated at four thousand … are all young men who maintain military discipline and drill regularly in the country.”
   <p>Murphy’s March 3 report also gave a comprehensive summary of the Nazi Party’s antisemitic platform and propaganda.  The Nazis, he said, “endeavor to prove a united Jewish movement for world hegemony using Soviet Russia as an illustration of the first important step.”  The Nazis’ accusations against the Jews, though “vague and nebulous,” were widely believed.  “Even many members of the middle class, professors, doctors, etc., are ready to believe on an empty stomach that the Jews and socialists are to blame if convincingly told.”  In the space of half a year, the Nazis had grown from a nonentity in Murphy’s reports to the central topic, far overshadowing all others throughout these months of 1923.
   <p>During the upcoming months of spring and summer, a Nazi Party <a href="inotesii4.html#ii470">recruiting drive</a> in Bavaria met with tremendous success, nearly tripling the number of Party members, from 20,000 to 55,000.  Stormtroop ranks increased apace.  Beginning in April 1923, evidence began to accumulate showing Catholic priests aiding and abetting the Nazis’ recruiting drive, including <a href="inotesii4.html#ii471">field masses and special liturgies</a> for the stormtroops’ weekend events across Bavaria.

<h4>Catholic Clerical Support for the Continuing Rise of the Nazi Party</h4>

   <p>On April 29-30, 1923, the Sunday edition of the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> contained a feature that would appear in every Sunday edition until November:  a listing of the Sunday mass times in the Catholic churches of Munich.  Given the copyright and defamation laws of Germany and Bavaria, this feature could not be published in the Nazi newspaper without the ongoing consent of the Archdiocese of Munich.  It conspicuously confirmed the standing of the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> in the “good press.”  Also beginning in April, a priest from a diocese outside Bavaria, Fr. Lorenz Pieper, began to hold services and talks in support of the Nazi Party throughout Bavaria.  Such activities by a visiting priest <a href="inotesii4.html#ii472">required prior approval</a> from the hierarchy in each diocese where they occurred. Pieper's arrival in Bavaria was announced on the front page of the <em>Miesbacher Anzeiger</em>, a Catholic daily newspaper edited by Bernhard Stempfle, the Catholic priest who later helped Hitler write <em>Mein Kampf</em>.
   <p>In the same issue with the mass time listings, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii473">announced</a> a major event for the Nazi SA and allied paramilitary forces on Sunday morning, April 29, in Ingolstadt, including participation by a Catholic parish priest.  The next issue of the Nazi paper, on May 1, <a href="inotesii4.html#ii474">described</a> the event as a tremendous success, with a thousand stormtroops and thousands of people gathered to hear a speech by Hitler after a flag blessing, a field mass and an “inspiring nationalist sermon” by the local priest.  The <em>Ingolstadt Free Press</em>, which had called futilely for the enforcement of the Republic Defense Law against Cardinal Faulhaber eight months before, was now reduced to <a href="inotesii4.html#ii476">reporting</a> helplessly about the “armed procession of the Nazis” while lamenting the injustice of local authorities allowing the April 29 Nazi event at the same time they were prohibiting a May 1 workers’ parade through Ingolstadt.
   <p>In Munich, a workers’ May Day celebration was allowed to proceed.  The Nazis showed up in force, uniformed and armed.  Vice Consul Murphy described the scene:
<blockquote>During the celebration approximately 2,000 National Socialist (Hitler) ‘shock troops’  fully outfitted with side arms, steel helmets, uniforms, etc., several bomb throwers and machine guns were held in check and prevented from colliding with Socialist groups by a detachment of Reichswehr in armored motor lorries, and by the police.  Due to excellent police control and supervision, only a few minor street brawls, netting one killed and several wounded, occurred.</blockquote>
   <p>Murphy concluded that the Nazis’ violence and incidents of intimidation “have done much to render Hitler’s movement unpopular with the conservative element in Bavaria.”  Although Murphy said public opinion was swinging against Hitler, he still apparently regarded the Nazi movement as significant enough to merit many pages in his State Department situation <a href="inotesii4.html#ii477">report</a>.  We found no evidence that Cardinal Faulhaber or his archdiocesan weekly took action in the first five months of 1923 to distance themselves from the Nazi movement.  
   <p>On June 12, 1923, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> reported on a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii478">Catholic mass</a> for Nazi and other <em>Völkisch</em> forces at the Basilica of St. Boniface in Munich.  The mass took place on Sunday, June 10th following a large outdoor rally at the Königsplatz, where Hitler spoke.  The events were held in memory of an accused German terrorist, Albert Schlageter, a Catholic, who had been executed by French occupation forces in the Ruhr Valley.  Hitler's speech invoked God's blessing for a violent uprising of the German <em>Volk</em>:
<blockquote>Lord God!  We promise you that we will sacrifice ourselves to the last breath for our freedom, and for that give us your blessing!  Not for peace and not for rest is the spirit of resistance, until the day arrives when it will be sounded throughout Germany: The <em>Volk</em> arises!  The storm breaks out!</blockquote>

<p>Shortly afterward, "God's blessing" was conferred on the uniformed Nazis, with their swastika flags, by Abbot Schachleiter of the Benedictine order.  In his sermon, Schachleiter used words recalling Faulhaber’s words of August 1922, condemning the Weimar Republic by denouncing “the curse of the criminal Revolution that cries out to heaven” and the “outrages by those who incurred the guilt for our debacle through their unpatriotic ways.”   During the consecration, the stormtroopers’ flags, on either side of the altar, were lowered on command, in accordance with German military customs for field masses. The Nazi newspaper concluded its account with a vow "dedicating all our strength to the reconstruction and the future of our <em>Volk</em> community [<em>Volksgemeinschaft</em>]." Nuncio Pacelli was <a href="inotesii4.html#ii480">invited</a> to attend this ceremony "but excused himself on account of meetings that had been arranged long before."

<h4>The <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> Publishes Two Pieces About Nazism</h4>

<p>On June 17, 1923, the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> published an article entitled "German-<em>Völkisch</em> - Antisemitism, Fascism, National Socialism," excerpted from a new book by Munich theologian Erhard Schlund, OFM. While Father Schlund had <a href="iparii1.html#schlund">avoided antisemitic propagandizing in his 1919 book</a> on Bolshevism and the Munich Soviet Councils Republic, now he embraced it. Like <a href="iparii1.html#gemlich">Hitler's 1919 letter to Gemlich</a>, Schlund's 1923 book endorsed "rational" rather than emotional or extremist antisemitism. Schlund's excerpt in the archdiocesan paper began with an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii481">affirmation</a> of the Nazis' central racial tenet:

<blockquote>In the German-<em>Völkisch</em> movement lies a good kernel, which possesses a strong inner right-ness:  That is the striving to preserve the purity of the German race.  But around this good kernel lies a bad husk.  That is the character of extremism.</blockquote>

<p>The article proceeded to express support for the antisemitic movement insofar as it was combatting the influence of Jewry and its “avaricious quest for money and material possessions, the predominance in the financial realm, the destructive influence of Jews upon religion, morals, literature and art and political and social life.” Thus the Nazis' struggle against "Jewish finance" and "Jewish Communism" were <em>not</em> extremism. The article understood Nazism as a "counterstroke" against Marxism, which "has become a danger to the world." In opposition to Marxism, Fascism "proclaims the freedom of the person," "combats revolution," and "demands the rule of the head, the reason of the Führer." The article took no issue with the Nazis' clear articulation of "what should be put aside" - understandably, since the Nazis' condemnation of the Weimar Republic was consistent with Cardinal Faulhaber's.

<p>Thus, at the height of the Nazi recruiting drive of 1923, with Bavarian priests publicly supporting Nazi paramilitary functions, the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> provided <em>guidance</em>. The article concluded by reminding readers that it was their Church leaders who would provide the essential ongoing guidance:

<blockquote>In all events a Catholic must be careful and reserved, for the aforesaid reasons, toward this movement, which can yet develop much differently than perhaps it has appeared to date.  Moreover, Church authority has not yet spoken.</blockquote>
 
   <p>On July 1, 1923, the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> published a short piece preferring the Christian cross over the swastika.  Entitled “Ave Crux!” [Latin: “Hail the Cross!”], this piece stated in full:
<blockquote>The new gospel that is preached to us today, the gospel of the swastika, will not be able to save the modern world, because hatred and force do not produce any lasting peace.  Our cross knows no twists!  It is the simple old Christian cross, on which our Lord and Master died.  It is the same holy cross whose sign our worthy Catholic mother first taught us to make on our forehead, mouth and breast, which will one day be pressed in our final hour into our fast-chilling hands, as legitimation for our far journey into a better world.  Our respects to you, holy cross, our only hope in life and in death!</blockquote>
   <p>This language asserted the dominance of the religious over the temporal, of the cross taught by Roman Catholicism over the swastika of the Nazi movement. Neither this article nor any other material we found in the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> from 1920 through 1923 rejected the core elements of Nazi antisemitism. On the contrary, the paper's spring 1920 message endorsing "lawful measures" against Jewish influence, building explicitly on a long heritage of Rome against the Jews, remained the operative guidance. The consistent message over more than three years was that Nazi tenets, recruitment and paramilitary activities were acceptable for Catholics so long as they remained in line with Rome.

<p>Clerical support for the Nazi Party recruiting drive in Bavaria continued during July and August 1923. With the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> continuing to publish Catholic mass schedules for the Archdiocese of Munich, Father Lorenz Pieper continued giving well-publicized talks at Nazi Party gatherings.  On July 24, 1923, he spoke in Munich on “<a href="inotesii4.html#ii481a">The History and Meaning of the Swastika</a>,” purporting to prove that it was a Christian symbol. On August 24th the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> covered his talk on the topic “Can a Catholic Be a National Socialist?” Father Pieper, like Father Schlund two months before, endorsed Nazi racism enthusiastically:

<blockquote>God himself created the peoples differently according to blood, character and type, and thus wants the distinctions of blood, <em>Volk</em> and races.  He also desires that what he created be kept and preserved pure.  So we must turn away from everything that impairs racial purity.  For this reason the racial viewpoint of National Socialism corresponds completely with Christianity.</blockquote>

<p>Pieper proceeded to justify militant antisemitism as a moral imperative. Far from prohibiting it, Christian love of neighbor <em>demanded</em> it:

<blockquote>Every Jew is from the outset a hidden danger to the Christian religion, and for this reason the Jew must be driven out of the public life of Christian peoples.  The <em>Völkisch</em> movement is reproached for lack of love of neighbor on this ground, but it is an expression of neighborly love to keep one's fellow men away from moral dangers, and it is an offense against Christian love of neighbor to dawdle while humanity is being plundered morally and economically by the Jews.</blockquote>

<p>The highest goal of the Nazi Party, according to Father Pieper, was the preservation of the Catholic denominational school: "It fights above all for Christian education and the denominational school." This battle had been foremost as well in the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper</em> during the post-war years. It was a vital issue in the ongoing Concordat negotiations. In sum, according to Pieper, Catholics could be antisemites and Nazis and still could "identify with every single doctrine of faith and moral law of the Catholic Church."


<p>These talks by Father Pieper appear to be characteristic of his spring and summer 1923 speechifying in Bavaria. On August 28th, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> again <a href="inotesii4.html#ii483">reported on a talk</a> by Father Pieper, this time at a packed hall in Regensburg, Bavaria, on the topic “National Socialism and Christianity.” This article identified Pieper as a "Cathedral Vicar" of Munich. Based on scripture and pronouncements of "high princes of the Church," Father Pieper demonstrated, according to the Nazi paper, that racial purity was a duty. Antisemitism, he declared, was not un-Christian, but rather a command of God.

<p>We have not been able to find anything to indicate that Cardinal Faulhaber or Nuncio Pacelli repudiated any part of Father Pieper's message. Nor, apparently, did they do anything to counteract the impression that the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> had authority to publish Munich's mass schedules, that the Nazi paper was accurately reporting the pro-Nazi activities of priests, and that those priests were in good standing with the Church. Bavarian Catholics who read the "good press" had reason to believe their highest Church authorities wanted them to support racism, antisemitism and the Nazi recruiting drive.</p>

<h4>Hitler Prepares for a Putsch</h4>

   <p>In early September 1923, Hitler became <a href="inotesii4.html#ii484">co-leader</a> with General Ludendorff of the newly formed “Patriotic Fighting League” [<em>Vaterländischer Kampfbund</em>].  From this point, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> intensified its attacks on the Weimar Republic with <a href="inotesii4.html#ii485">headlines</a> such as “Hitler: ‘the Republic is ripe for Collapse,’” “The Collapse of the November Treason,” and “The Only Task: Rooting Out Marxist High Treason.”

   <p>By October 1923, it became evident that Hitler and Ludendorff, with the Nazi Party and allied forces, had become strong enough to strike fear in the governing authorities.   The German Government faced enormous <a href="inotesii4.html#ii486">challenges</a> during 1923, including the French occupation of the Ruhr district, runaway inflation, Bavarian separatism, Communist uprisings, and counter-revolutionary elements in the German Army.   Meanwhile a major objective of Cardinal Faulhaber and the Vatican, the approval of a new Bavaria-Vatican Concordat, remained in doubt. 

   <p>On October 6, 1923, the most prominent Catholic politician in Bavaria, the chairman of the Catholic Bavarian People’s Party, wrote an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii488">urgent letter</a> to Cardinal Faulhaber, pleading with him to stop the Nazi momentum among Catholics and Bavarians. Heinrich Held presented a rationale for Cardinal Faulhaber to take a stand against the Nazi movement that many of his clergy, consistent with his own words against the Revolution, had encouraged over the preceding months: the Nazis were now in league with Ludendorff, a Protestant from Prussia. Hitler himself, Held added, was an adherent of the "Free from Rome" movement. And the broader leadership of the Nazi-<em>Völkisch</em> movement were mostly Protestants, non-Bavarians, and North Germans.

<p>Held said the Nazis had become so strong among Bavarian Catholics over the past year, aided by clerical "agitators" conducting "field masses," that no governmental authority could now stop them:

<blockquote>Your Eminence!  The danger is enormously great.  No government or representative of the people can master this danger, because a year-long lying and poisoning demagoguery has deprived them of respect and trust, even among a considerable portion of the Catholic population.</blockquote>

<p>Avoiding the obvious fact that respect and trust toward Weimar democracy had been undermined by the Cardinal's own words the year before, Held begged Faulhaber to speak out now against the Nazis. In Held's view it was only the Cardinal, in union with high Catholic authority, who could master the Nazis' counter-revolutionary threat:

<blockquote>Thus there is only one salvation and it lies with Your Eminence and the episcopate as a whole.  Your Eminence, do not take it as presumption, but as an imploring request, arising from a recognition of facts, from a true son of the Church and a friend of the Fatherland, if I implore Your Eminence to stake out a sure signpost showing the way out of this intellectual and spiritual entanglement, by means of an open strong word of warning and resistance to the Catholic people.  I am convinced that one word from Your Eminence will bring our Bavarian Catholic people back to their senses and to proper Catholic and Bavarian behavior.</blockquote>  

<p>Although the historical record contains no response from Cardinal Faulhaber, events would prove that when he finally took a stand against the Nazis one month later, it was based on Held's suggested rationale. Heinrich Held, moreover, became a key figure in gaining final approval for Rome's long-sought Bavarian Concordat. Becoming Bavarian Minister-President in June 1924, Held oversaw the process leading to a close but successful Landtag vote in favor of ratifying the Concordat in early 1925. Unlike the succession of short-lived Minister-Presidents that preceded him, Held continued in that post for almost a decade, until March 1933.


<p>On October 13, 1923, the Chancellor of Germany, Gustav Stresemann, wrote an equally desperate <a href="inotesii4.html#ii489">letter</a> to Cardinal Faulhaber, begging for his help.  Stresemann was facing the climax of one of the worst hyperinflations in history, at the same time as the Nazis were openly threatening to overthrow the Weimar Republic. Even though he was a Protestant Chancellor in a majority Protestant country, Stresemann looked to Cardinal Faulhaber as foremost among "friends of the Fatherland" who could save the Weimar Republic by speaking out:

<blockquote>In the struggle for the soul of the people the Catholic Church and its leaders have always been able to exercise a great influence... If Your Eminence would have the kindness to involve yourself in the service of matters of this moral rebirth of the people, then Your Eminence would be heard far beyond the bounds of your co-religionists, by the entire German people. We need speeches to the German nation that show us the way from the depths to the heights, out of darkness into light... If Your Eminence is not inclined to refuse this appeal, then please be convinced that the Reich Government will consider it a matter of honor to place all possible support at the disposal of this work, and I ask that you consider me at your disposal in this regard.</blockquote>

   <p>Cardinal Faulhaber left Stresemann hanging in suspense for the better part of a month before answering on November 6th with a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii490"><em>refusal</em> to help</a>. Faulhaber cited unspecified "reasons of health" and "considerations of Church law," expressing an aversion to "intervening in purely political developments." At the same time, Faulhaber's response left open the prospect of cooperation, on his terms rather than Stresemann's, in order to avoid the civil war that was looming between the Weimar Republic and the Nazi forces in Bavaria:

<blockquote>How should we master the immensely growing economic crisis and the coming misery of winter with unemployment, if all the moral powers do not work together without distinction of denomination and social class and party?  How otherwise do we intend to dismantle the hatred that rages blindly against our Israelite fellow citizens or wholesale against other ethnic groups, without any indication of guilt on the part of the individuals who are condemned, or how do we prevent a civil war that would inevitably bring new devastations and would seal the misery of our poor people with self-destruction?  History testifies that civil wars are always the bitterest and bloodiest and most damaging wars.</blockquote>

During the first week of November, Cardinal Faulhaber also <a href="inotesii4.html#ii491">denounced</a> "blind hatred" against Jews from the pulpit of the Munich Cathedral.  He said that Jews, like all persons, must not be denied food and shelter, adding:  “With blind hatred against Jews and Catholics, against farmers and Bavarians, no wounds will be healed.” Consistent with the <em>Munich Catholic Church Newspaper's</em> article of June 17, 1923, rejections of antisemitic "extremes" such as blind hatred were not the same as rejections of antisemitism <em>per se</em>. The Nazis' <em>Völkisch Observer</em>, not attuned to subtleties, responded on November 6th to Cardinal Faulhaber’s words from the pulpit by <a href="inotesii4.html#ii492">mocking</a> him for inconsistency with his prior statements, including his denunciation of the “Jewish press.”  Its headline was “Cardinal Faulhaber as Jew-Protector.”  The same issue repeatedly employed Faulhaber’s phraseology from a year before, about high treason, traitors, and criminals at the heart of the Weimar Republic, which was now “ripe for collapse.” But Cardinal Faulhaber's words against blind hatred toward Jews and Catholics presaged the stand that some key Bavarian Catholics would take against the Nazis' Putsch attempt later that same week.

<h4>Hitler’s “Beer Hall Putsch”: November 8-9, 1923</h4>

   <p>As the Nazis' continued their <a href="inotesii4.html#ii493">open preparations</a> in early November for an armed uprising against the Weimar Republic, Cardinal Faulhaber was in a strong position to deal on his terms with the political powers of Bavaria and Berlin who were so desperate for his help against the manifest Nazi threat. The Cardinal's priority remained the concluding of the Bavaria-Vatican Concordat, and that is what he secured.   On November 8, 1923, a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii494">note</a> from Cardinal Faulhaber to Nuncio Pacelli stated that an acceptable draft of the Bavarian-Vatican Concordat was now at hand. Those Catholics and others in Bavaria who expected Faulhaber's support at a day of reckoning for the "congenitally tainted," Cain-marked Weimar Republic, were in for a big surprise.
   <p>Also on November 8th, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii495">called</a> for mass gatherings of “Party members” and “antisemites” at 8 p.m. that evening in two towns outside Munich.  This was about half an hour before the time Hitler launched his coup d’état in Munich.  On the same page, an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii496">article</a> entitled “The 9th of November,” the date of the November 1918 Revolution, presented the rationale for the counter-revolution, including the words “perjury and high treason” in the opening paragraph. 
   <p>At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 8, several hundred armed SA stormtroops surrounded the Bürgerbräukeller, a Munich beer hall where Bavarian State Commissar Gustav von Kahr was giving a speech to a large crowd, which included all but one of the Bavarian cabinet ministers.  Hitler, entering the beer hall with other top Nazis, fired a pistol shot into the ceiling, jumped up onto a table, and announced the start of the national revolution.  Hitler forced Kahr into a side room.  After talking with Hitler, Kahr and the heads of the Bavarian military and police announced to the crowd that they would support Hitler and his military commander, General Ludendorff.  Hitler announced the new counter-revolutionary government of Germany, with himself as head, Ludendorff as military commander, and Gustav von Kahr and Ernst Pöhner as President and Premier, respectively, of the Bavarian State Government.  As of midnight, when U.S. Vice Consul Murphy sent a courier with a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii497">telegraph message</a> for the U.S. Ambassador in Berlin, the way appeared open for Hitler to carry out his plan of replicating Mussolini’s 1922 March on Rome with a March on Berlin, having Ludendorff at his side and thousands of stormtroops behind them.  
  <p>Commissar Gustav von Kahr’s announcement early in the morning of November 9th that he was opposing Hitler and Ludendorff, and that his support the evening before had been procured by coercion, led to the collapse of the Putsch.  The decisive moment came shortly after midday on November 9th, when Hitler and Ludendorff, marching with armed stormtroops  toward key government buildings in Munich, ignored a command to halt from a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii498">relatively small force</a> of Bavarian police and Bavarian soldiers.  A brief exchange of fire killed over a dozen Nazis and several of the police and soldiers.  Hitler fled, the Nazis dispersed, and the Putsch came to an inglorious end.

   <p>The defeat of Hitler’s Putsch had a significant Catholic subplot.  The first Bavarian authority to take a public stand against the Putsch was the cabinet minister who did not attend Kahr’s speech at the Bürgerbräu, Bavarian Kultusminister <a href="inotesii4.html#ii499">Franz Matt</a>.  A loyal Catholic, Matt took a decisive step during the late evening of November 8th.  Working with others at the Munich office of the Catholic Women’s League, Matt prepared posters declaring that the Bavarian Government was still in power, and that persons acting in rebellion against it would be considered traitors.  The posters exhorted Bavarians not to follow the Prussian Ludendorff.  The posters, signed by Matt, were posted in Munich around 3 a.m. on the morning of November 9th.  At some point in the early morning Kahr announced his opposition to the Putsch, but apparently not before the posters were printed, or they would logically have borne his name instead of or in addition to Matt’s.

   <p>Ludendorff and many Hitler supporters blamed Cardinal Faulhaber for turning Kahr from support of the Putsch to opposition.  Protests against Cardinal Faulhaber, including by students at the University of Munich and by other Catholics, were voluble in the days after the Putsch, and continued for months afterwards.  Faulhaber denied all involvement.  Claims by some that Franz Matt was at dinner with Cardinal Faulhaber and Nuncio Pacelli on November 8 were denied on grounds that he was away on a business trip, or at the theater.  The November 9, 1923 issue of the <em>Völkisch Observer</em>, published in expectation that the Nazis had taken over the Bavarian Government and would march on Berlin, contained a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4102">detailed article</a> about the exchange of letters between Chancellor Stresemann and Cardinal Faulhaber.  The Nazi editors tried to speculate why the Cardinal had refused the Chancellor’s desperate appeal for help.

   <p>Also on November 9th, the Bavarian ambassador to the Vatican, Baron von Ritter zu Groenesteyn, <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4103">reported</a> from Rome:  “In the Vatican there seems to be doubt whether it would be possible to conclude a concordat with a dictator, because it is to be feared that its legal validity might subsequently be contested by the representatives of the people.”  The entire report reflects the situation before noon on November 9th, before it became clear with the exchange of fire shortly after midday that the Putsch had failed.

<h4>The Aftermath of the Putsch</h4>

   <p>The failure of the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch sparked months of acrimony between the Catholic Church hierarchy and the <em>Völkisch</em> movement, including the many Catholics who had joined in supporting the Nazis and their <em>Völkisch</em> allies during 1923.  Catholic university students, other Catholics in Munich, as well as Ludendorff and likeminded <em>Völkisch</em> non-Catholics, bitterly accused Cardinal Faulhaber and the Vatican of selling out the Putsch by backing the existing order during the night of November 8-9, 1923.  Loyalist Catholics organized counter-demonstrations and affirmed their support of Church leaders.  The result was a dramatic rift between Catholic authority and the <em>Völkisch</em>-Nazi movement. From this point forward, the thousands of Bavarian Catholics involved in the Nazi Party either <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4105">left the Nazi Party or became totally alienated from Catholicism</a>.  Of the Catholic priests who supported the Nazis' 1923 recruiting campaign in Bavaria, almost all ceased their pro-Nazi activities after the Putsch.

  
<p>Meanwhile, Cardinal Faulhaber’s words of November 8 that an acceptable draft of a Vatican-Bavaria Concordat was now in hand proved to be a harbinger of success.  The Concordat negotiations, stalled for three years by impasses at the state and national level, now moved rapidly to conclusion.  On November 23, Chancellor Stresemann resigned, and the new German Government under Chancellor Wilhelm Marx of the Catholic Center Party did not stand in the way of Bavaria, a German state, entering into an international treaty with the Vatican.  On January 26, 1924, Franz Matt transmitted the final version of the Concordat to Nuncio Pacelli.


<p>On February 15, 1924, Cardinal Faulhaber gave a significant <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4105a">speech</a> to a largely academic Catholic audience at the Löwenbräu Beer Hall in Munich. While criticizing the anti-Rome nature of the German <em>Völkisch</em> movement, Faulhaber affirmed the "originally pure spring" of Nazism. Characterizing pagan and anti-Rome trends in the Nazi movement as a "deeply moving tragedy," Faulhaber called them a poisoning influence upon the original Nazi fountainhead. At the same time, Faulhaber praised Hitler as an astute leader in harmony with Rome and Catholic authority.  The relevant passage reads as follows in translation.

<blockquote>Adolf Hitler knew better than the <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4105b">Diodochi</a> of his movement that German history did not first begin in 1870 or in 1517, that for the re-establishment of the German <em>Volk</em> the power sources of Christian culture are indispensable, that this work of re-establishment cannot be accomplished with the cult of Wotan and hatred of Rome.  As a man of the <em>Volk</em> he also knew the soul of the South German <em>Volk</em> better than others, and knew that with a movement whose flip-side is struggle against Rome, the soul of the <em>Volk</em> will not be won over.  There is a deeply moving tragedy in the fact that the originally pure spring became poisoned by later influences and by <em>Kulturkampf</em>.</blockquote>

   <p>In light of the militant antisemitic campaign in Faulhaber's archdiocesan weekly paper in spring 1920, and the interplay at that time with the newly launched Nazi Party's antisemitic propaganda and program, it is hard to understand Cardinal Faulhaber's extraordinary speech <em>apart</em> from Nazi antisemitism. While Faulhaber did not tell the Catholic audience what the Nazi fountainhead consisted of, any reader of the "good press" of Munich or Rome over the previous four years was well-informed that opposing "Jewish imperialism" and Zionism, and campaigning for "lawful measures" against the Jews were endorsed rather than condemned by high Catholic authority.

 
 <p>On February 26, 1924, Hitler went on trial in Munich for treason.  The trial lasted through March, with prominent news coverage throughout Germany.  Taking full advantage of his opportunity for nationwide publicity, Hitler claimed full responsibility for the Putsch, as his effort to destroy Marxism in Germany.

   <p>On March 20, 1924, the Bavarian-Vatican Concordat gained an essential green light from the German Reich Government.  Chancellor Marx advised the Bavarian Government that the Reich Government would not object to the state entering into the Concordat.  The Concordat was signed officially on March 29, 1924 by Nuncio Pacelli and representatives of the Bavarian Government.

 <p>On April 1, 1924, Hitler was found guilty of treason and sentenced to five years in prison. He was given the spacious room previously occupied by the assassin of Kurt Eisner, Bavaria's first socialist Premier. With the assistance of Nazi Party members who were allowed virtually unlimited visitation, Hitler dictated </em>Mein Kampf</em> while in prison. Hitler also received assistance on the book from Fr. Bernhard Stempfle, a Catholic priest who supported the Nazi movement both before and after the Putsch.

<p>On April 6, 1924, a Nazi-<em>Völkisch</em> coalition ran candidates in the election to the Bavarian Landtag.  They won 35% of the votes in Munich, <a href=inotesii4.html#polling">outpolling every other party</a> in that city and cutting deeply into the Catholic Bavarian Peoples Party’s vote total.  
 
  <p>On April 26, 1924, in order to counter the influence among Catholics of the continuing nationalist and <em>Völkisch</em> press campaign against the Vatican and Cardinal Faulhaber, Nuncio Pacelli recommended that <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4110">Rome advance sainthood causes</a> from Bavaria, for candidates whose “reputation as saints in Bavaria is very strong.  Although in matters of this kind, every question of nationality must be disregarded, it seems that the rapid commencement of such proceedings would redound to the lively satisfaction of German Catholics and contribute to the strengthening of their attachment to the Apostolic See.”  Minutes of the next annual Bavarian Bishops conference mentioned three sainthood candidates whom they might put forward.  One of them, Peter Canisius, S.J., was declared a saint and a “Doctor [teacher] of the Church” eight months later.

<p>On June 28, 1924, Heinrich Held became Minister President of Bavaria, a post he continued to hold until March 1933.

<p>During the course of 1924, as Bavarian Catholic leaders <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4106">rallied</a> support for Cardinal Faulhaber and opposition to the Nazi-<i>Völkisch</i> movement, the coalition lost most of its Catholic support.  By the end of the year, the Nazi-<em>Völkisch</em> Block was reduced to single digits in Munich in a Reichstag election.  Nazi Party electoral support in Bavaria remained in the single digits through the 1920s, with Nazi candidates polling 6% of Bavarian votes in the 1928 Reichstag <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4107">elections</a>.

<p>On December 20, 1924 in Bavaria, Hitler was released from prison, four years early, as the result of a pardon granted by the highest court of Bavaria. Soon after his release, he had a meeting with General Ludendorff, who had been acquitted at his treason trial in early 1924.

<p>On December 20, 1924 in Rome,<em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published an <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4113">article</a> entitled “An Episode of Zionism in Palestine.” Building on the pattern of its 1920 and 1922 articles, the journal strove to turn a minor incident into a discrediting of both the Zionist movement and the British Mandate Government under Sir Herbert Samuel in Palestine.

   <p>On January 15, 1925, the Bavarian Landtag ratified the Vatican-Bavaria Concordat by a vote of 73 to 52.  <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4114">three-page summary</a> of the articles of the Concordat. With this act, Nuncio Pacelli had accomplished his years-long quest, which had kept him in Munich even while accredited to Berlin as the Vatican's Nuncio to Germany. For unknown reasons, he remained in Munich for a further seven months.


    


<h4>1924-1934:Is There Evidence of Further Authoritative Catholic Promotion of Nazism and  Antisemitism Between 1924 and 1934?</h4>

<p>It is important to investigate whether the authoritative Catholic support for Nazi-style antisemitism in the early 1920s was reversed, countermanded or discontinued after the Putsch or the decade that followed.  We have found no evidence that it was. 


<p>In 1925, the same year Hitler's <em>Mein Kampf</em> appeared, a book also appeared by Cardinal Faulhaber. <em>Deutsches Ehrgefühl und Katholisches Gewissen</em> [The German Sense of Honor and the Catholic Conscience] contained the words of Faulhaber's February 1924 speech at the Löwenbräu Beer Hall. Thus his words embracing Hitler and the "originally pure spring" of Nazism reached a broader audience, in printed form, during the first year when Hitler was reasserting his leadership and rebuilding the Nazi Party after his release from prison.

   <p>In mid-1925, Herbert Samuel stepped down as High Commissioner of Palestine and was replaced by a non-Jewish British career military officer.  Jewish immigration to Palestine dropped precipitously. From more than 30,000 in 1925, the numbers plummeted to less than 14,000 in 1926, and then 3,000 or so in 1927 and subsequent years.

   <p>On August 20, 1925, Nuncio Pacelli moved from Munich to Berlin to devote his attention to the post that had been officially his since mid-1920: Vatican Nuncio to the German Reich and <em>doyen</em>, or dean, of the diplomatic corps accredited to Berlin. In the course of fulfilling his five-year quest for the new Vatican-Bavaria Concordat, Nuncio Pacelli had established a reputation as an exceedingly well-informed and diligent <a href=inotesii4.html#movetoberlin">Church diplomat.</a> 
From the Vatican's nunciature in the Tiergarten district of Berlin, Pacelli became a prominent figure in the diplomatic and social life of the German capital. <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4114b">Franz von Papen described</a> how Pacelli overcame the initial suspicion of largely Protestant Prussia:

<blockquote>However, his personality was soon appreciated at its true value, and when he finally left Berlin, after signing a limited Concordat with Prussia, which at least gave the capital a Catholic Bishop, he was seen off by immense crowds which had come to pay tribute to him rather than his religion.  While he was living in Berlin I occasionally had the honour of inviting him to meet some of the country's leading conservative and Catholic personalities.</blockquote>

<p>During the period 1925 through 1927, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> did not publish any attacks on Zionism or Jewish-Bolshevism as far as we could tell. Although the journal <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4115">featured</a> news items about the Middle East and articles on Bolshevism, it did not use these as occasions for continuing its earlier anti-Zionist propaganda.

<p>On May 19, 1928, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> included a reaffirmation the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory in a <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4117">lengthy article</a> entitled “The Jewish Danger and the ‘Friends of Israel.’”  The author assured readers he did not want to “attribute to the Jews the complete guilt for the worst events that have affected modern society,” but he then continued,
“we have tried to make clear in these pages how much guilt and how much influence Jews had in the Russian Revolution, as in the French, and recently in Hungary ...” (p.342)

   This article long appeared puzzling in the context of a Vatican doctrinal decree of March 25, 1928, referenced in the article, which condemned “that hatred which is commonly called antisemitism.”  This decree of the Vatican's doctrinal office against antisemitism was issued jointly with a decree forcibly dissolving the most prominent association in the Catholic Church seeking to counteract antisemitism, the "Friends of Israel."  A <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4118">German church historian</a> recently explained the contrast between the March decree and the May <em>Civiltà</em> article, based on newly accessible documents in the Vatican Secret Archives.  It appears the condemnation of antisemitism was intended to prevent criticism of Pope Pius XI for dissolving the Friends of Israel.

<p>Also in 1928, Ludwig Kaas, a Catholic priest who had long worked as a consultant with Nuncio Pacelli, became the head of the Center Party of Germany. It was the first time in the six-decade history of Germany's major Catholic party that a clergyman held the party's top position.

   <p>On February 11, 1929, the Vatican entered into three agreements with Mussolini’s Italy: the Lateran Treaty recognizing the Pope’s sovereignty over the approximately 100-acre territory of Vatican City; an Italian-Vatican Concordat making the Catholic Church the established Church of Italy and giving the Catholic hierarchy a measure of control over education in government schools; and a financial settlement giving the Vatican approximately $90 million dollars in compensation for the loss of the Papal States 70 years before. During the years-long negotiations between Italy and the Vatican, one of the lead Vatican negotiations was Francesco Pacelli, who was a civil lawyer and Eugenio's older brother.

<p>Shortly thereafter, on February 22, 1929, the <em>Völkisch Observer</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4120">published a statement</a> by Hitler on the Vatican-Mussolini agreement.  In light of what would transpire in Germany four years later, it was a significant announcement of Hitler’s views and intentions.  Under headlines on page one such as "The Recognition of the Fascist Concept of Government by the Pope,” <em>Observer</em> editor Alfred Rosenberg, among the most openly anti-Catholic of the leading Nazis, inserted a preface: "This newspaper needs to undertake herewith a correction of its party-policy view of the Holy Father."  Hitler’s words followed:

   <blockquote>For if the Church today has come to an understanding with Fascist Italy, which was unthinkable with liberal democratic Italy, then it is conclusively demonstrated that the Fascist realm of ideas is more closely related to Christendom than is the Jewish-liberal one, much less the atheistic-Marxist one, with which the self-styled Catholic Center Party feels so closely bound today, to the detriment of that same Christendom and of our German Volk.  If the Pope today comes to such an understanding with Fascism, then he is at least of the view that Fascism and thereby Nationalism are acceptable for the faithful and are compatible with the Catholic faith.  But how then can the "Bayerischer Kurier" of Munich, for example, as the so-called "Catholic newspaper," fill believers in the Pope's policy with doubt about its own position?  I foresee a day coming when the Pope will welcome it if the Church, right in front of the Center Party and its ilk, is taken under the protection of National Socialism.
 
  <p>One thing stands established, and therein I see the great significance of the treaty concluded between the Pope and Mussolini: it is henceforth demonstrated by a historical event that Nationalism is not, as the German Center Party and its newspapers deceitfully maintain, inherently anti-Christian and anti-Church. The Nationalist worldview – no matter whether it is Fascist in Italy or National Socialist in Germany – is a positive Christian one, and every good Catholic can, just like every committed Protestant, be an opponent of parliamentary government and a supporter of the Nationalist idea of dictatorship.</blockquote>


<p>On June 14, 1929, Nuncio Pacelli signed a Concordat between the Vatican and the German state of Prussia. A Catholic Diocese of Berlin was established for the first time; prior to this, Berlin and the Prussian heartland in northeastern Germany did not have a Catholic Bishop. With its heavily Catholic areas in the Rhine and Moselle valleys in western Germany, Prussia had more Catholics than any other German state.  Bavaria had the second most.


 
  <p>In 1929, Pacelli’s last year as Nuncio to Germany, he answered a request from the Vatican Nuncio to Austria for information about Hitler and the Nazi Party. After describing Hitler as a political agitator, <a href="inotesii4.html#added">Pacelli added</a>: "It goes without saying that I have never met this man.”</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1929, Eugenio Pacelli left Berlin for Rome.  Elevated to Cardinal early in 1930, he succeeded his mentor, Pietro Gasparri, as the Vatican's Cardinal Secretary of State.</p> 

<p>Beginning in the fall of 1930, following a dramatic rise in Nazi Party strength in the Reichstag in the September 1930 elections, high level Church authority issued statements <em>against</em> Catholics joining the Nazi Party.  On October 11, 1930, <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> wrote that membership in the Nazi Party was “incompatible with Catholic conscience,” just like membership in any other socialist party.  In the months that followed, German Bishops’ conferences issued pastoral statements, which we saw above, stating that Catholics could not in good conscience become members of the Nazi Party.

   <p>In August 1931, German Reich Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, a practicing Catholic, met with Cardinal Pacelli, and later wrote that Pacelli insisted he enter into a coalition government with the Nazis. <a href="inotesii4.html#ii4122">Brüning’s memoirs</a> describe his audience with Cardinal Pacelli, including this passage:
   <blockquote>Pacelli broached the matter of the Reich Concordat... Pacelli thought I should just form a government with the Right with a view toward a Reich concordat and make it clear in the process that a Concordat was to be concluded immediately.  I retorted that he was misperceiving the political situation in Germany and above all the real nature of the Nazis. (p. 358)</blockquote>

   <p>Toward the end of a 45-minute contentious meeting, Cardinal Pacelli returned to the subject:
 
  <blockquote>He thought he had to repeat his request that I enter into a coalition with the Nazis.  I explained to him that all the attempts to enter a coalition with the Right in a responsible manner for the nation and the people had failed.  He misperceived the nature of Nazism.  The Social Democrats in Germany were not religious, but they were tolerant, while I was so far convinced that the Nazis were neither religious nor tolerant. (p.359)</blockquote>

<p>Heinrich Brüning remained Reich Chancellor until May 1932, as Germany's economy went from bad to worse during the Great Depression.  In June 1932, President Hindenburg appointed his old military friend, Franz von Papen, as Chancellor. 

<p>On October 12, 1932, the Vatican entered into a Concordat with Baden, the German state with the third most Catholics.  The state-level Vatican concordats with Bavaria, Prussia and Baden now covered more than 90% of the total Catholic population of Germany.

<p>In November 1932, lacking support in the Reichstag, Papen resigned as Chancellor.  Hindenburg replaced him with General von Schleicher, who likewise lacked the support of a parliamentary majority.
 

   <p>Also in November 1932, Cardinal Pacelli’s long-time collaborator, Fr. Ludwig Kaas, wrote an article about what had, in fact, been the central quest of Cardinal Pacelli’s diplomatic career under Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI, i.e., Vatican concordats.  Kaas was very close to Nuncio Pacelli in the 1920s, becoming chairman of the Catholic Center Party in 1928, and was even closer after leaving that position in April 1933 to live and work with Pacelli in Rome for the rest of his life, into the 1950s.  Kaas’s article, “The Concordat Model of Fascist Italy,” published in early 1933, praised Mussolini’s Italy and went on to praise totalitarian government in general as a concordat-worthy partner for the Vatican.  Father Kaas’s concluding words summed up his thesis:

<blockquote>one hopes that the concordat-related encounter between the Vatican and the “totalitarian state” is seen as something that goes down in history not as a fleeting episode, but as a viable ongoing action.</blockquote>

<p>Kaas's article was published in early 1933 by a prestigious German legal journal.  The opportunity for a "concordat-related encounter" with a new "totalitarian state" arrived quickly in Germany.  


<p>On January 30, 1933, Hitler came to power as Chancellor, in a coalition government with Papen as Vice Chancellor and the Nazis in control of the crucial Interior Ministry, with authority over the police.The Vatican's newspaper gave front page coverage to Hitler's accession to power, with no criticisms or reservations about him or his movement. German newspaper headlines announced a friendly exchange of letters between Kaas and Hitler in early February.</p><br>

<p>At the end of February 1933, Hitler and Göring, in charge of the police, used a fire in the Reichstag building in Berlin - allegedly set by a Dutch Communist, but just as likely set by the Nazis themselves - as the pretext for a Reich decree suspending freedoms of press, speech and assembly, as well as protections against search and seizure and arbitrary arrest.

<p>On March 5, 1933, a nationwide election for delegates to the Reichstag was held amidst intimidation of the press and the voters, with Goebbels' propaganda machine now financed by the German Government.  The Nazis narrowly failed in the goal to win a majority of seats.


<p>On March 9, in a state-level coup d'état, the Nazis took over the Bavarian Government. That same day, they brutalized anti-Nazi editor Fritz Gerlich in Munich. When the Dachau Concentration Camp was opened several days later, Gerlich became one of its first inmates, remaining there until he was killed on the Night of the Long Knives.

<p>On March 10, Cardinal Faulhaber had an audience with Pope Pius XI in Rome. <a href=>Faulhaber's notes</a> of the meeting record that the Pope praised Hitler: "He has pleased me, he is the first statesman who has spoken against Bolshevism."  Faulhaber explained to the Pope Hitler's tolerance of Rosenberg and other anti-Catholic Nazis: "He does not say anything contrary to Rosenberg and the others hostile to the Church, because he fears to be considered as a Rome-ling, a lackey of the Pope."  Faulhaber also recorded that the Pope had received news of the Nazis' brutal treatment of Fritz Gerlich.  We have not found any indication that Cardinal Faulhaber or the Vatican interceded in any way for Gerlich with the Nazis.

<p>On March 12, Hitler and Hindenburg issued the flag decree requiring civilian installations to fly the swastika with the black-white-red German Reich tricolor.

<p>On March 18, Vice Chancellor Papen proposed to Cardinal Bertram, the head of the German Bishops Conference, that the Bishops remove their prohibitions on Catholics joining the Nazi Party.  Bertram replied that was impossible unless the Nazis fundamentally changed their program and ideology.

<p>On March 23, 1933, Hitler gave a <a href=>speech in the Reichstag</a>, promising to respect the existing Vatican concordats with the German states of Bavaria, Prussia and Baden; offering to cultivate "friendliest relations with the Holy See," and endorsing cooperation of the Christian churches with the regime in "the fight against materialistic ideology and for a real <em>Volk</em> community [<em>Volksgemeinschaft</em>."

<p>Hours later, the Center Party provided the essential votes for a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag for the "Enabling Act" [<em>Ermächtigungsgesetz</em> or "empowering act"], which gave Hitler, in consultation with his cabinet, power to rule by decree for the upcoming four years. The Center Party delegates voted unanimously for the Enabling Act, with ex-Chancellors Brüning and Wirth arguing against, and Kaas insisting successfully on a unanimous vote by all Center Party delegates.

<p>On March 29, the German Bishops, in a joint pastoral statement, announced they were removing their prohibitions on Catholics joining the Nazi Party. The Bishops' statement said that prior warnings about Nazi ideology remained in place. But the Bishops did not repeat the substance of those warnings, and large numbers of Catholics, along with other Germans, rushed to join the Nazi Party in the months that followed. 

<p>The Bishops' statement of March 29, 1933 refused to accept the swastika flag into the churches, stating tactfully that political flags should be excluded "by informal advance agreement to the extent possible."

<p>On April 1, 1933, the Nazis conducted the first nationwide German boycott of Jewish businesses.  The boycott lasted only one day and sparked protests from other countries. The German Bishops did not protest the boycott.

<p>On April 7, Hitler used his powers under the Enabling Act to decree the firing of Jewish civil servants.  President Hindenburg insisted on an exception for war veterans.

<p>Around Easter, which fell on April 16 in 1933, Vice Chancellor Papen had an audience with Pope Pius XI in Rome. Papen <a href= >recorded in his memoirs</a> the Pope's favorable comments about Hitler on that occasion, in these words:

<blockquote>His Holiness greeted my wife and me with complete fatherly kindness and with the words, how happy he was to see in Hitler a personality at the summit of the German Government who had inscribed on his flag the uncompromising struggle against Communism and Nihilism.</blockquote>


<p>On April 20, 1933, Fr. Kaas, who had left Germany permanently at the beginning of the month to work with Cardinal Pacelli in the Vatican, sent birthday greetings to Hitler by telegram.

<p>On April 26, a German Catholic Bishop, Wilhelm Berning, <a href="inotesii4.html#HitlerBerning">met with Hitler</a> for over an hour.  During the meeting, Hitler announced his intent to move decisively against the Jews of Germany:

<blockquote>I have been attacked on account of my handling of the Jewish question. For 1500 years the Catholic Church regarded the Jews as pestilent, sent them into the ghetto, etc., since the Jews were recognized for what they were.  In the time of liberalism this danger was no longer recognized.  I am going back to the time of what was done for 1500 long years.  I do not place race over religion, rather I recognize the pestilence of the representatives of this race for State and Church, and perhaps I am rendering the greatest service to Christianity; that is the reason for their expulsion from the universities and governmental positions.</blockquote>


<p>On May 8, Nuncio Orsenigo sent a detailed report about the Berning-Hitler meeting to Cardinal Pacelli, including a full account of Hitler's words about the "Jewish question." There is no evidence that the Vatican or any German Bishop ever indicated to Hitler, at this time or any later time, that persecution of Jews was <em>not</em> a "great service to Christianity."

<p>During April through June 1933, the Vatican negotiated terms for a Vatican-Germany Concordat.  The lead negotiator for Germany was Papen.  The lead negotiator for the Vatican was Cardinal Pacelli, assisted by Father Kaas.

<p>On June 18, 1933, Cardinal Pacelli personally consecrated Alois Hudal a Bishop in Rome.  Hudal's official duties did not change.  He remained Rector of the Anima chapel and residential college in Rome. His unofficial activities from this time forward are documented above.

<p>On June 30, 1933, Cardinal Gasparri, the retired Vatican Secretary of State who had invited Eugenio Pacelli to work with him on the Canon Law project before World War One, and who remained Pacelli's immediate superior through the 1920s, wrote the following memorandum.  The memorandum resides in the Vatican Secret Archives and has been transcribed and published by historians who have read it in the Archives in recent years.  The <a href="inotesii4.html#Gasparrimem">memorandum</a> is notable both for its substance and for its tone.

<blockquote>June 30, 1933

<p>As long as Hitler does not declare war on the Holy See and on the Catholic hierarchy in Germany,
<p>1.	the Holy See and the Catholic hierarchy in Germany are to refrain from condemning Hitler's party
<p>2.	if Hitler wants the dissolution of the Catholic Center as a political party, he is to be obeyed without making a noise
<p>3.	the Catholics are free to join Hitler's party, as the citizens of Italy are free to join the Fascist party
<p>4.	the Catholics of Germany are equally free to not join Hitler’s party, but always within the limits of the law, as the Catholics of Italy are relative to the Fascist party.  I believe that Hitler's party responds to nationalist sentiment in Germany: therefore, a political-religious struggle in Germany over Hitlerism is absolutely to be avoided, especially while the Secretary of State is his Eminence Cardinal Pacelli
<p>Cardinal Pietro Gasparri</blockquote>


<p>On July 5, 1933, the Center Party announced it was dissolving.  This ended a six-decade tradition of the main Catholic political party in Germany.  The Vatican announced that it had no involvement in the decision, which was made solely by the leaders of the Center Party.

<p>On July 8, the negotiators initialed an agreed draft of the Vatican-Germany Concordat in Rome.

<p>On July 14, at a meeting with his cabinet ministers, Hitler declared that with the concluding of the Concordat with the Vatican, "a sphere of confidence has been created that will be especialy significant in the urgent struggle against international Jewry."

<p>On July 20, the Vatican-Germany Concordat was signed in Rome. Cardinal Pacelli was the signatory for the Vatican, with Vice Chancellor Papen signing for the German Reich.

<p>In the following week, <em>Osservatore Romano</em> published the articles of the Concordat on the front page.  The Vatican newspaper published the full text of the Concordat the day after its signing.  Other articles have been cited for the proposition that concordats did not confer Vatican approval on governments.  Hitler's remarks of February 1929 about the Mussolini-Vatican agreements, however, placed the world on notice that he would trumpet a Vatican-Germany Concordat as a Vatican approval of his Fascist movement.

<p>Also in late July, Cardinal Faulhaber sent a telegram to Hitler, praising him for accomplishing more in six months than the parliamentary politicians of Germany had accomplished in six decades. Faulhaber's words echoed the words from Kaas's article published shortly before:
<blockquote>The [Fascist Italian] dictatorship, in the space of ten years, has brought about more public benefit than any of the other more familiar forms of government in the world.</blockquote>

<p>On August 19, 1933, British diplomat Ivone Kirkpatrick <a href="inotesii4.html#Kirkpatrick">reported</a> to the British Foreign Office about a private conversation he had with Cardinal Pacelli.

   <blockquote>Cardinal Pacelli equally deplored the action of the German Government at home, their persecution of the Jews, their proceedings against political opponents, the reign of terror to which the whole nation was subjected...
   <p>These reflections on the iniquity of Germany led the Cardinal to explain apologetically how it was that he had signed a concordat with such people.  A pistol, he said, had been pointed at his head and he had had no alternative.  The German Government had offered him concessions, concessions, it must be admitted, wider than any previous German Government would have agreed to, and he had to choose between an agreement on their lines and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.</blockquote>


<p>On September 9, 1933, Cardinal Pacelli lodged a <a href="inotesii4.html#confprotest">confidential protest</a> with the German Government against the persecution of Catholics of Jewish descent.

<p>On September 10, 1933, the Concordat was ratified by the Vatican and the German Reich and officially went into effect. Within days, the Nazi regime was suppressing Catholic newspapers and associations in Germany.  

<p>In October 1933, Cardinal Pacelli sent a lengthy protest note to the German Government and began face-to-face negotiations with German negotiator Buttmann concerning the implementation of the Concordat. Those negotiations, as we have seen, never produced an agreement.

<p>On November 18, 1933, <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> published an article on the significance of the Vatican-Germany Concordat.  The tone and substance of the article were directly opposite to Cardinal Pacelli's private remarks to Ivone Kirkpatrick three months earlier.  The <em>Civiltà Cattolica</em> <a href="inotesii4.html#greathour">article expressed enthusiasm for the Concordat</a> for reasons going beyond its legal protections:

<blockquote>"But its inestimable importance derives not so much from the fact itself as from the range and circumstances of its existence: not so much from the Concordat as from the close concord between the Holy See and Germany, from the extent and the totality of the matters embraced in this concord."</blockquote>

<p>The article concluded with ominous musing about what could be accomplished by the hoped-for close concord between the Vatican and Germany:


<blockquote>"... with this, hope is established for the future, if the rulers are not lacking in a sense of good faith and integrity, which must be assumed in all honest contracting parties, and much more in the men of the German Government, who are well aware of the terrible ‘present hour.’  Nor should we vainly skip by the ‘great hour’ that is passing, for we can truly call it ‘a historical and providential hour’ for Germany.  But why not also add:  for Christian Europe and for all the civilized world?"</blockquote><br>
